## What ClickUp is

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) is an all-in-one productivity platform that helps teams and individuals manage tasks, projects, and workflows in one place. It offers features like task management, document collaboration, goal tracking, and automation to streamline work efficiently.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to ClickUp**

Open your Fillout form or create a new one. Head to the **Integrate** page and look for `ClickUp`. Then, connect to your account.

</Frame>

### **2. Map your form fields**

First, select a **workspace** and a **list**. Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new` to reference ClickUp fields from the left to Fillout form fields in the right.

</Frame>

### **3. Publish and share**

Once your form’s all good, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`. Now, you’ll see a new task in your ClickUp list for every new form submission.

## Create tasks based on conditions

You can choose to create certain types of issues when a condition is met. For example, create cards for different lists depending on what respondents specify in the form. More details [here](/help/conditional-integration).
