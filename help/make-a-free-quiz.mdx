## How to create a quiz in Fillout

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new quiz">

First, [sign up](https://build.fillout.com/signup) for a free **Fillout** account, then click [here](https://build.fillout.com/new/).

If you already have a form that you want to turn into a quiz, go to its **Settings**. Click `Quiz mode` in the left-hand panel to toggle the `Quiz mode enabled` switch.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your questions">
  Drag and drop the quiz questions you'd like to use from the left-hand panel to your form. Select from dozens of different types.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up scoring">
  Assign score values to each question. **Fillout** automatically tallies the scores for you. Click a question followed by the `quiz icon`.

  </Frame>

  Put a `tick mark` on the correct answer. You can choose multiple correct answers, if applicable, and even define a score value for each answer. Typically, you’ll want to assign a score of 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect answers, but you can use different values if you’d like to weigh questions unequally.

## Advanced quiz features

### Accessing the respondent’s score in the quiz

You can [reference](/help/answer-piping) the respondent’s score anywhere in the quiz, even while the quiz is still in progress. Use this to set up conditional logic (like showing [different pages](/help/page-logic) to people who score differently) or to [show or hide](/help/conditional-hiding) fields dynamically.

Type `@` anywhere and select `Score`.
