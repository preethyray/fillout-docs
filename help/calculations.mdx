## Add a calculation

Open the `Logic` modal in the bottom-right of your form editor.

<Frame>
  ![Screenshot of the Logic tab of a form](/images/logic/image-8.png)
</Frame>

Click `Calculations` followed by `+ New calculation`. Here, you’ll be able to add, edit, and delete calculations in your form.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Add your calculation by giving it a **Name** and **Type**. The name refers to how you’ll refer to it in-app, whereas the type can either be one of these:

- **Number** - if you want to compute some numerical result, like a price or a score
- **Text** - if you want to compute some dynamic text, e.g. some text that depends on a user’s selections in the form.
- **Duration** - if you want to compute the interval between two dates, e.g. age or term period

Then, provide an **Initial value** for your calculation.

Every calculation has some value that it starts with, e.g. defining what a variable starts out as. Some common examples:

- **0** - if you want to add to a price variable over time as the respondent picks options
- **100** - if you want to deduct points for wrong answers on a quiz from 100
- **Any arbitrary text** - for a **text** calculation (or leaving it empty)

**Define Rules** for how the value of your calculation changes.

A rule is made up of 3 main parts:

- **Operation** - this is what you want to do to your calculation, e.g. Add a number to it
- **Operation value** - this is the value that interacts with the operation, e.g. Add whatever number you provide
- **Condition** - this defines **when** you should perform that operation. This is similar to how you might [hide/show a question depending on user input](/help/conditional-hiding)

You can **drag and drop conditions** using the handle on the right-hand side to reorder them. Rules will take effect in the order that they appear on this screen. For example, you can add 5, and then multiply by 2, instead of doing it vice versa.

## Common ways to use your calculations effectively

### Set the price for your Payment page

After adding a payment page, type `@` or click the `+` icon to reference a calculation instead of a static price for your payment page.

Now, the price will change depending on the customer’s order.

### Display the calculation in your form

Anywhere in Fillout, you can type `@` to [reference previous answers or calculations](/help/answer-piping). You can [style this text](/help/themes) by highlighting it and changing the font size, weight, or color.

### Determine age, trip duration, warranty validity, and more

When making a new calculation, choose `duration` as the type. Select **Start** and **End** dates in your calculation followed by the measurement for **Units**.

### Pre-fill fields with a calculation

Much like how fields are [pre-filled](/help/prefill-fields) elsewhere in Fillout, you can reference calculations there as well.
