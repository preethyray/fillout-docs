  **Good to know:** You can invite as many respondents as you'd like.

The recipients will receive an authenticated link to the form via email. Any changes made by any of the recipients will be **automatically synced across all the respondents**.

<Note>
  Changes to the form are only synced to integrations (like Airtable, Notion, and SmartSuite) when the form is re-submitted. Partial submissions are viewable on the Results page of your form.
</Note>

## Tracking results

In the `Track responses` tab in the **Share** page, you can view any in progress or completed form submissions, along with who the form respondents are. Even for partial submissions, you can view the current form results or the authenticated form link.
