## What is Notion

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the most popular all-in-one productivity and collaboration tools. It’s a flexible workspace for teams and individuals to create and organize notes, documents, databases, and task lists.

## How it works

### 1. Create your database in Notion

<Note>
  If you already have your database created in Notion, you can skip this step.
</Note>

Create a [Notion page](https://www.notion.com/help/create-your-first-page) and type `/database`. Name your database and add a column for each question. Set the property type (e.g., Text, Select, Multi-select) and, if using Select or Multi-select, enter the answer options.

### 2. Create your form in Fillout

In your [Fillout dashboard](/https://build.fillout.com/), click `+ Make a Fillout` followed by `Connect` and choose Notion.

Choose your theme (don’t worry, you can always change this later). Then, enter your **Account name** and `Connect to Notion`.

<Note>
  If you have multiple Notion workspaces, ensure you're connecting to the right one. Switch workspaces from the top right of the popup.
</Note>

`Select pages` you’d like to allow Fillout access to. You can add and remove pages to this integration anytime in your Fillout dashboard.

<Note>
  **Troubleshooting:** Don’t see your database in the dropdown list? Check you have connected to the correct workspace and granted access to the page where your database is.
</Note>

### 3. Map your questions

Your `Notion Columns` now appear in the left sidebar of your Fillout form editor. Simply drag & drop to start building your form.

To connect a new question to your Notion database, or check an existing connection, click the `settings icon` of a field to open the right sidebar. Click **Connected**. You can also add content to the body of a Notion page. See this [help article](/help/notion-add-page-content).

<Tip>
  If you make changes in your Notion database that you want to reflect in your Fillout form, hit the Refresh Notion Connection icon <Icon name="arrows-rotate" />.
</Tip>

### 4. Publish & Share

Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go\! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Notion database.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/help/conditional-integration).

  **Good to know:** Fillout has many powerful features like [**branching**](/help/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/help/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.
