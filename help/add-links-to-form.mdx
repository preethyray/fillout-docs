## How to add a link through text

Highlight any text in your form and click the `link icon` to enter your link.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/advanced/image-33.png" />
</Frame>

Your link will appear blue and underlined, which will open in a new tab when clicked.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/advanced/image-34.png" />
</Frame>

## Add **URL buttons**

You can add a button to an ending page. Drag and drop the `URL button` to the form. To customize, click the `button` followed by the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/advanced/image-35.png" />
</Frame>

You can even make the URL dynamic based on form inputs by clicking the `+` icon.

## **Automatic redirects**

You can also link to an external page automatically, via a redirect. See [ending page](/help/ending-page) for details.
