## What ActiveCampaign is

[**ActiveCampaign**](https://www.fillout.com/integrations/activecampaign) is a platform for email marketing and lead nurturing, enabling businesses to automate personalized communications and targeted campaigns for effective customer engagement and conversion optimization.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to ActiveCampaign**

Open the form you want to `Integrate` with ActiveCampaign.

  **Important:** When creating your form, make sure to set the email, name, and other fields you would like to link to your ActiveCampaign list to **required**.

Enter your **API URL** and **API Key** from ActiveCampaign into Fillout. Go to the link in the banner to learn how to find these. Then, select a **List** in ActiveCampaign you’d like to connect to.

### **2. Map your form fields**

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your ActiveCampaign list. For example, link the email address to its respective field.

</Frame>

You can use other **Fields**, such as name, number, and more in your form to update your contacts' details.

### **3. Publish and share**

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. After publishing, answers to mapped fields from new submissions will appear in your ActiveCampaign list. If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.

## **How to add tags**

You can add ActiveCampaign tags to new contacts automatically to help group your newsletter audiences. `+ Add tag` and choose from the dropdown.

</Frame>

To add a tag to specific contacts, toggle the `Add contionally?` switch. `Set conditional logic` and choose when to apply it. For example, we'll add the New tag when a customer hasn't been part of our waitlist before.

Remember to click `Publish` after making any changes to the integration.

## **Specify a condition**

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. More info [here](/help/conditional-integration).
