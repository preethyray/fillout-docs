## How to choose a template

First, find the template you would like to clone [here.](https://fillout.com/templates) Then, click `Use template`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/template.webp" alt="Screenshot of the Form templates page" />
</Frame>

Alternatively, you can click `+ Make a Fillout` on the **homepage** followed by `Templates`.

That’s it! You now have access to that form on your account. Make any changes you need, [customize it](/help/styling), [connect an integration](/help/integrations), and [publish your form](/help) once you’re good to go.

## Make your own template

You can even make your own template from one of your forms and share it inside or outside of your organization. More details [here](/help/make-a-form-template).
