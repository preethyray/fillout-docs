## Invite a team member to your workspace

On your **Fillout** dashboard, click `Invite member` in the upper right corner.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/account/image-7.png" alt="Invite a team member to your workspace" />
</Frame>

Enter the emails of the people you would like to invite. You can choose to invite them as:

- **Admin** - have full access to the workspace enabling them to view and edit settings
- **Basic user** - can create their own forms and scheduling links, but cannot edit anyone else's
- **Limited access** \- read or write access to specific workspaces you share through [granular permissions](/help/granular-permissions)

<Frame>

</Frame>

The invitee will get notified through their email. Upon clicking the link, they will be redirected to a sign up page and prompted to join the organization.

<Note>
Invites sent expire after 14 days, however you may send them another invite after the expiration date.
</Note>

## View pending invites

Click your **account name** in the bottom right corner followed by `Settings & Members`.

<Note>
Only admin accounts have access to view and edit team members.
</Note>

Then, navigate to `Invites` from the top menu. You can also `Resend` or `Delete` an invite from here.

## Share a specific form

Quickly share a single form by clicking the `+` icon beside your avatar. Add specific people to share with or generate a link for anyone. Adjust read and write permissions as needed.

## Grant granular permissions

You can limit team member access, set users to read-only and limit access to connected integration accounts with [granular permissions](/help/granular-permissions).

## How to effectively work with collaborators

### View and discuss form submissions together

Gain insights by analyzing data together as a team. Individual members can apply personalized filters to focus on desired analytics for tailored analyses. Additionally, they can [leave comments](/help/comment) and tag other users.

### Work on separate forms at the same time

With multiple collaborators working in tandem, tasks can be divided and accomplished more quickly, reducing the time required for form creation and data collection. Collaborators cannot edit the same form at the same time, but can edit different forms simultaneously.

### Invite an expert to help build a form or consult on it

You can invite consultants or anyone part of your workflow to help build your forms. Note that consultants may also want to [import/export forms](/help/importing-and-exporting-forms) from their accounts instead.
