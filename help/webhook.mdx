## What is a webhook

A **webhook** is a way for one system (like **Fillout**) to send real-time data to another system (like the 3rd party tools you use) as soon as an event occurs. Under the hood, a webhook is an **HTTP callback** and can be a GET, PUT, POST or DELETE request.

## Connect your form to a webhook

### 1. **Link your Fillout form to** a webhook

Go to **Integrate**, and click `Webhook`.

</Frame>

Enter your **Webhook URL**, and `Test` it. When you're good with it, click `Finish setup`.

### 2. Publish and share your form

Thats it\! You have all you need to configure a webhook when the form submits. `Publish` it and share the link.

## Available webhook options

Toggle the `Advanced view` switch to set up your webhook with any of the parameters or arguments you need.

For these examples, let's assume your URL is something like:

https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12475312/abc/


Each of the sections in the **Webhook** integration do the following:

**URL parameters**

- These get added to the URL at the end.
- The left-hand side is the **key**, and the right-hand side is the **value** from your form or from anything else you can reference in **Fillout**.
- For example, if you add, on the left hand side, **source**, and then on the right hand side, **pick reference** of some short answer in your form, then your webhook will send:
    - [https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12475312/abc/?source=answer](https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12475312/abc/?source=%3Canswer) to the short answer

    - So if someone answered Facebook in the form, you will send: [https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12475312/abc/?source=facebook](https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/12475312/abc/?source=facebook)

**Body**

- This is used if you're sending a **POST** request. Most of the time, services like Zapier and Make will accept either **GET** or **POST**, and you can send information in the body of the message if you prefer instead.
- If using fields in the body of the message, make sure to process these correctly in Zapier/Make to make sure that they're coming in the body and not the URL.

**Headers (optional)**

- Most users will not need to use this section. This is typically if you have an advanced webhook setup which requires sending extra headers
- The most typical use case for headers is if you have some verification required for your endpoint, and you have a special key you want to send, which will look something like:
- Authorization --> Bearer \<secret_token\>

**Cookies (optional)**

- Similar to headers, most users will not need to send any here.
