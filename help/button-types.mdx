## List of button types

By default, your form will have the following buttons:

- **Next**  - assigned button for form, review, payment, login, and scheduling [pages](/help/page-types)
- **Submit** - button to proceed to the [ending page](/help/ending-page)
- **Back**  - located on the upper left corner, allows respondents to view previous pages
- **Start** - found in [cover pages](/help/cover-page)

You can also add:

- **Skip** - button that lets respondents proceed to the next page without answering the current one

## Edit button labels

## Change button alignment

In the right-hand panel settings, choose between the following **Alignment** options:

- <Icon icon="arrow-left" /> - left aligned
- <Icon icon="arrow-right" /><Icon icon="pipe" /> <Icon icon="arrow-left" /> - center aligned
- <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> - right aligned
- <Icon icon="arrow-left" /> <Icon icon="pipe" /><Icon icon="arrow-right" /> - expanded or same width as your form's text

## Customize button design and animation

The **Background color** of your button is determined by the [**Primary**](/help/themes) color you choose in your **Theme**. You can change its color through the right-hand panel.

  **Good to know:** Changing the background color of your button will not change the primary color of your form.

You can also change the shape of your button by clicking `Theme` on the upper left part of your form followed by `Advanced designer`.
