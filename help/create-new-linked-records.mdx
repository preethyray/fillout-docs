## How to create new linked records

Add a `record picker` to your form. In the right-hand panel, enable `Can create new records?`.

</Frame>

If you'd like to customize the record creation form (e.g. to mark fields as required), click `Edit record creation form`.

That's it\! Your users can now click `Create new` to open up a form that lets them make a new record (associated with the linked record).

## Allow creating new records, but not selecting existing records

Enable the `Only show new records` to let users create new records only. When enabled, clicking the linked record picker opens the child form directly.
