## How to send a custom email

Click **[Workflows](/help/workflows)** on the top menu. Then, choose a template under **Notifications**. Alternatively, you may open a form and go to its **Settings** followed by **Custom emails**.

</Frame>

Choose if you want to send one right away through a **Thank you email**, **Send email only if conditions match**, or **Send email after delay**.

`Create workflow` and select which form you’d like to **apply the workflow to** in the dropdown menu. Then, `Edit` the content of your email

Edit the **Subject**, add **Attachments**, choose where to **Send email from**, and more. You can also opt to `Send from your Gmail +` account.

## Format email style

To customize the look of your message, go to `Email`. Select your preferred **Style** and **Theme**. Click the `+` icon to add more **Text**, an **Image**, **Spacer**, and a link **Button**.

To change the text formatting and color, simply highlight any text.

You can also pipe answers, like First Name, by typing `@` or clicking the blue `+` icon and choosing the corresponding field or question.

[Calculations](/help/calculations) can also be used to insert dynamic text into your emails. Be sure to `Test` your email workflow before clicking `Publish` on the upper right corner.

## Send different messages based on responses

You can send a different message to a group of respondents depending on the answers they have provided in the form. Choose **Send email only if conditions match** under **Notifications**. `Create workflow` and `Edit` the **Filter**.

Set up conditional logic by choosing a question followed by a condition. For example, we’ll send a custom email to those who responded Yes to Will you be attending the event?

## Send emails after a specified duration

Opt to **Send email after delay** and `Edit` how later you want to send it in minutes, hours, or days.
