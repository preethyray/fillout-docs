One of the most important parts of connecting to a database is connecting your form fields to actually be sent to your database when the form is submitted.

## How to map fields

### 1. Connect a database

Head to **Integrate** and connect your form to [Airtable](/help/airtable), [Notion](/help/notion), [HubSpot](/help/hubspot), or [other databases](/help/integrations).

### 2. Drag and drop synced columns

Go back to **Edit** in the top menu. In the left-hand panel, you'll see columns from your database automatically synced. Drag and drop these to your form.

## Mappings

You might want to send additional information to Airtable, Notion or other databases when a respondent submits your form, other than your form fields. For example, you might want to save:

- [URL parameters](/help/url-parameters)
- [Static values](/help/integration-static-values)
- Submission date
- [Fields from the record returned after logging in](/help/login-page)
- [Fields from a pre-fetched record](/help/pre-fetch-data)

You can create a field, [pre-fill](/help/prefill-fields) it with a value, and connect it to Airtable or Notion through the **Connected** menu in the right-hand panel.

**Mappings** in the **Integrate** page also lets you do this directly. For example, let's connect a URL parameter. `+ Add new`and pick a field in Airtable, and then any referenceable value in Fillout\!
