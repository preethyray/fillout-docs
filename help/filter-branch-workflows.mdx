## How to filter an action

On your dashboard, click [**Workflows**](/help/workflows) on the top menu followed by `+ Blank workflow`. Alternatively, you can open a form and click **Integrate** from the top menu to create a workflow.

First, choose a **trigger**. Then, select `Filter` as the first **action**.

`+ Add condition` and select a question or field from the first dropdown. In the middle dropdown, select an operator. In our example, we’ll choose equals. Then, pick an answer from the last dropdown that will trigger the next action when selected.

Choose the next **action** by clicking `+` under Filter. Let’s choose to send a message in `Slack` when a respondent RSVPs Yes. Remember to `Test` your workflow, before clicking `Publish` on the upper right corner.

That’s it\! Now you’ll receive summaries of those who answered Yes to your form in your chosen Slack channel.

## Add a branch to your workflow

You can also create different branches based on specific conditions. By adding a branch, you can ensure that the right action happens for each situation.

After selecting your form **trigger**, add a `Branch` **action**. Click `Edit` to set a condition, followed by `+` to define what happens when the condition is met.

In our example, we’ll send a summary of the responses to Slack when a respondent RSVPs Yes, whereas we’ll send them an email with a link to our fundraising page and newsletter when they respond No.
