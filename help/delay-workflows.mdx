## Overview

Delaying [actions](/help/workflows) gives you control over when tasks are triggered. You can set this delay to last for just a few minutes or extend it to hours or days, depending on your needs. This is especially useful for workflows that require follow-ups, reminders, or timed sequences.

### How to delay an action

On your dashboard, click [**Workflows**](/help/workflows) on the top menu followed by `+ Blank workflow`. Alternatively, you can open a form and navigate to **Integrate** to create a workflow.

Select a **trigger**. Then, choose `Delay` as your first **action** and set how soon you want a task to be done. The default is 30 minutes but you can delay for days.

Click the `+` icon under Delay to add another **action**. For this example, let’s choose `Slack`. Remember to `Test` your workflow, before clicking `Publish` on the upper right corner.

That’s it\! Now, every form submission will send its responses to your chosen Slack channel 30 minutes later.
