## Enriching leads and conditional routing

If you enable `Enrich with Clearbit` in the right-hand panel, you’ll receive access to the following properties after a respondent fills out their email:

- **Employee count** - total number of employees that work at the company
- **Employment name** - name of the company the person works for
- **Employment domain** - domain of the company the person works for
- **Employment role** - a person’s standardized role at the company they work for based on their title. [See all possible values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erIdqoy60JwLAnpb91EfoJV5YrXDnbwSaA-aqcBlw48/edit#gid=1522926464).
- **Company traffic rank** - a company’s standing in a global rank of company website traffic as calculated by Clearbit. [See all possible values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erIdqoy60JwLAnpb91EfoJV5YrXDnbwSaA-aqcBlw48/edit#gid=281531467).
- **Company employee range** - number of employees that work at the company by range. Useful for segmenting companies by size. [See all possible values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erIdqoy60JwLAnpb91EfoJV5YrXDnbwSaA-aqcBlw48/edit#gid=1202347353).
- **Company estimated annual revenue** - estimate of the company’s annual revenue by range. [See all possible values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1erIdqoy60JwLAnpb91EfoJV5YrXDnbwSaA-aqcBlw48/edit#gid=462196649).

With [page logic](/help/page-logic), you can conditionally route leads based on company size, industry, job title and more based on the data obtained from the email field.

<Info>
  **Common use case:** Route leads with over x employees to a [scheduling page](/help/scheduling-page) with your enterprise team. Or, create multiple scheduling pages to route leads based on region, industry or company size.

Lastly, you can send enriched data to [any integration](/help) by setting up additional mappings on the **Integrations** tab.
