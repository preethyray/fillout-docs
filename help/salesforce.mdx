## How it works

### 1. Connect your form to Salesforce

`+ Make a Fillout` or open an existing form. Navigate to **Integrate** page and look for `Salesforce`.

Click `Connect to Salesforce` to sign in with your Salesforce account. Then, choose an **object** where you would like to store responses to.

### 2. Map your form fields

Under **Mappings**, match the Salesforce fields on the left with the corresponding questions in your Fillout form using the dropdowns on the right.

Alternatively, you may choose to create a blank page, and drag and drop `Salesforce fields` in the left sidebar to your form.

  **Good to know:** These fields are automatically [mapped](/help/additional-integration-mappings) to their corresponding columns on Salesforce.
</Check>

### 3. Publish and share

That's it\! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner and share your link. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Salesforce database.

## Connect to a salesforce sandbox

After selecting `Salesforce` in the **Integrate** page, tick the `Connect to a sandbox organization` checkbox. Then, click `Connect to Salesforce`.

## IPs to whitelist

If your Salesforce organization restricts IP addresses for 3rd party app connections, you’ll want to whitelist the following IPs:

```
35.160.120.126
44.233.151.27
34.211.200.85
```

## Updating records from a form
