## How Fillout Scheduling Works

[Fillout Scheduling](https://www.fillout.com/scheduling) forms let people book available slots on your calendar while ensuring the time works for you. The forms show a calendar, meeting details, and organizer info by default. Respondents can select a date, time slot, and their timezone to view slots in local time.

Fillout will prompt for their name and email. After clicking `Schedule event`, they'll see a confirmation and get a Google Calendar invite with video details (if applicable) and a reschedule link. You'll receive an email with meeting details, and the event will be added to your Google Calendar.
