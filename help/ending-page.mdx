## How to add an ending page

An **ending page** is added by default when you create a new form. You can add more ending pages by clicking `+ Add page` followed by `Ending`.

<Tip>
  Use [page logic](/help/page-logic) to send different users to different ending pages.
</Tip>

## **Ending page types**

In the left-hand panel, there are three types of ending pages you can choose from: **Page**, **New form** and **Redirect**.

### **Page (default)**

The default **ending page** thanks respondents for submitting a form. Users can customize the thank-you text, add images, banners, and other fields to display upon submission via the left-hand panel or by clicking and highlighting the text.

### **New form**

This **ending** type lets users redirect respondents to another form and can optionally pass URL parameters, such as carrying over the respondent's name to the next form. See [here](/help/combine-and-repeat-forms) for more information.

### **Redirect**

This redirects users to another link like your homepage or portal after form submission, skipping the default Fillout ending page.

  This feature is available on **Starter**, **Pro**, **Business**, and **Enterprise** plans. Learn more about our pricing plans and advanced features [**here**](https://www.fillout.com/pricing).
</Note>

## Ask respondents to fill out your form again

Respondents can fill out your form multiple times. Simply add a `Fill again` button from the left-hand panel. More details [here](/help/fill-again-button).

## Add a link on the default ending page

Click or drag and drop the `URL button` in the left-hand panel. Then, click the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel, and customize it as you see fit.

## Allow respondents to save a copy of their responses

Add a `Send response` or `Download PDF` field. Upon entering their email, respondents will receive a copy of their form submission.
