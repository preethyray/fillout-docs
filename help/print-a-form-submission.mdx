## Where hard copies can help you

### Annotate responses

Printing submissions makes it easy to review submission data in a format that works best for you. With hard copies, you can read, highlight, and annotate responses, making data analysis more accessible and convenient.

### Share data

Printed copies of individual responses are an easy way to share data with colleagues, stakeholders, or clients. They are a quick way to share insights with those who may not have access to your survey results or prefer physical copies.
