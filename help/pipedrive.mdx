## What Pipedrive is

[Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform designed to help businesses manage sales pipelines and customer interactions more effectively. It offers tools for tracking leads, automating tasks, and analyzing sales data to optimize sales processes and improve performance.

## How it works

### 1. Connect your Fillout form to Pipedrive

Open your existing form or create a new one, then go to **Integrate** from the top menu. Look for `Pipedrive`.

</Frame>

### 2. Map form fields

Choose the relevant options in the dropdown menus. Enter values or reference field answers like the name by clicking the `+` icon or typing `@`. Click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner after setting up the fields.

### 3. Publish and share

`Preview` your form to test it. Once everything’s good, `Publish` your form and share its link or embed it on your website.

That’s it\! Now every time a form is completed, you’ll see its responses in the **Deals** page of your Pipedrive dashboard.

## Add a lead only when a certain condition is met

You can choose to sync form responses only under a specific condition. Check out this [quick guide](/help/conditional-integration#bbe44591cc624d09b3cf1198e66b75e0).
