## Why you should verify submissions

Verifying submissions ensures that the information you receive is accurate and authentic. It helps prevent spam and fraudulent entries, saving time and resources. Additionally, verification builds trust with users by protecting their data and maintaining the integrity of your brand.

## Enable SMS mobile verification

Drag and drop the `Phone number` field to your form or click it if you already have one. Similar to the steps above, turn on the `Send verification code` switch.

If your form is connected to [Twilio](https://build.fillout.com/home/integrations/new/twilio), our SMS verification feature will send messages using your Twilio account.

This feature is currently available for US and UK mobile numbers. However, you may request for your country to be added by emailing us at support@fillout.com.
