## Overview

When you [connect your Google Calendar to Fillout](/help/fillout-scheduling-intro), your default calendar will track conflicts and block existing events to prevent double-booking. New meetings will also be added to your default Google Calendar automatically. You can have Fillout also watch your other Google Calendars for events to ensure your availability.

## How to set up

Open your Fillout `Scheduling` dashboard from the top menu. Then, click `Calendars and apps`, and enable any alternate calendars you want Fillout to watch for conflicting events.

You can also change the default calendar where new events are added. Click the **Add to calendar** dropdown and select your preferred calendar.
