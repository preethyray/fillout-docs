## How to add a currency field

First, drag the `Currency` field type onto your form.

Input the **Currency code** for the currency you would like to collect. [Here is a list](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/glossary/currency-codes) of all the possible options. You can click the field followed by the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel.

## Collect a dynamic type of currency

If you'd like to let your respondents choose the currency type or if the currency type should be specified by an [external source](/help) (e.g. Airtable or Notion), use the `+` button to reference a prior field from that integration source.

For example, here we reference the From currency dropdown to make the dropdown determine the currency type.

## Convert currencies

Enable the `Convert currency` toggle in the right-hand panel to automatically convert the currency the respondent types in. You can specify a fixed currency to convert it to or provide it dynamically using the `+` button.

You can reference the converted amount anywhere in your form using the `+` button.
