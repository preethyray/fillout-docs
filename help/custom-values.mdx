## Overview

By default, when a respondent selects an option from a question that involves choices, that option shows up under the same name in the **Results** page. In the example below, if the respondent chooses Los Angeles International Airport, this is what will show up under Results.

By adding **Custom values**, you can change the text that will appear on the results page. For example, we can specify the value of the same choice, Los Angeles International Airport, to be LAX. This can be helpful when integrating your form to CRMs, databases or other tools.

<Note>
  This feature is applicable to Multiple choice, Dropdown, Checkboxes, Picture choice, and Multiselect field types.

### Use cases

#### Studies and research

In academic studies, use Custom Values to frame questions in a participant-friendly manner.

#### Multilingual forms

For forms in different languages, use Custom Values to show options in one language while your backend understands them in another.

#### Order fulfillment

For example, in an e-commerce form, use Custom Values to display product variations with user-friendly labels while maintaining specific backend values for inventory and processing.
