Fillout lets you make updatable forms. Let your users edit their answers anytime, ensuring you always have the most current information.

## When do I need an editable form?

Making your forms editable improves the accuracy of the data you collect and reduces back-and-forth with your users. Common use cases includes:

- When collecting RSVPs for an event, let users change their response if their plans change.
- If conducting a survey, let respondents update their answers if they have new information.
- Let users change their notification preferences down the line on a newsletter signup form.

There are a few ways to enable form edits in Fillout, depending on your needs.

## Option 1: Edit link sent by email

If you want every respondent to receive an edit link, this is the best approach. First, head to **Settings** from the top menu and enable `Respondent notifications`. Make sure to toggle `Include a link to edit submission`.

When the respondent submits the form, they’ll receive an email with a clear button to `Edit submission`.

Learn more about respondent notifications [here](/help/respondent-emails).

## Option 2: Send response field type

If you want to make the respondent notification opt-in, use this approach instead. On your form’s [ending page](/help/ending-page), drag-and-drop or click on the `Send response` field type in the left-hand panel.

When users submit your form, they’ll now see an option to enter their email address to receive a summary of their responses.

To include a form edit link, toggle the `Include edit link` switch in the right-hand panel. That’s it!

## Option 3: Send an edit link manually

First, head to the **Results** tab on your form and open the submission in question. Click `⋮` or the vertical ellipsis symbol followed by `Edit`. A new tab will open with the filled submission. Copy the link and share it.

## Updating integrations

With both the approaches described above, your connected 3rd-party integrations will automatically be updated whenever someone submits the edit link. For example, if your form is connected to Airtable, re-submitting the form from a respondent notification link will update the record in Airtable.

You can also set up edit links for specific integrations. See these guides or follow the same instructions for other integrations, like SmartSuite or Monday.com.

## Closing the form

If you’ve sent out an edit link but no longer want to accept submissions, you can always [close your form](/help/manage-form-access) to new submissions and edits.
