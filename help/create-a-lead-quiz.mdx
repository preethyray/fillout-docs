## Overview

Lead quizzes are a reliable way to collect relevant contacts for your sales or marketing efforts. They work by asking leads a series of questions and generating a personalized scorecard or recommendation based on the answers.

## How to build a lead quiz

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Quiz mode">
    Open an existing form or create a [new one](https://build.fillout.com/home/quizzes). From the Fillout dashboard `+ Make a Fillout`. Go to the **Settings** tab of your form followed by `Quiz mode` and enable this.

    Make sure to turn off `Show correct answers after each page` to ensure results are only accessible via respondent emails and custom end pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an email field and quiz questions">
    Back in the **Edit** tab of the form, scroll down to click `Email input` from the left-hand panel. Then, add your preferred quiz question fields.

    <Tip>
      Rename each page as you add fields to make it easier to find them when setting up conditions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose correct answers and score values">
    After adding a quiz question or field to a page, click it followed by the `Quiz` icon to open the answer key window.

    Add a checkmark next to each correct answer and provide a **Score** value.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize a quiz’s ending page(s)">
    By default, [ending pages](/help/ending-page) for quizzes will calculate and display each respondent’s total score. To hide this, go to your ending page from bottom of the screen. Click the score field, and turn off `Show quiz score` from the right-hand settings menu.

    For lead quizzes that don’t have correct/incorrect answers (e.g. Find out which workout routine is best for your body type), add text and media that is shown only when specific answers were provided throughout the quiz.

    Click on any field on an ending page followed by the **Logic** settings in the right-hand panel. Choose the `Show when` option, and click `Edit conditional logic` to configure when text or media should be shown or hidden.

    Sometimes, multiple ending pages are easier to manage than one with too many hidden fields.

    Click `+ Add page` at the bottom to add more **Ending** pages, and set up conditions that lead to these pages by opening `Logic`. Click the `+` icon and drag the connector to the corresponding end page.

## Set up custom respondent emails

Go to **Settings**, and click **Custom emails** to choose an [email workflow](/help/custom-emails). The quickest one to create would be the **Thank you email** option. `Create workflow` to `Edit` the content of your email.

You can edit the default **Subject** and reference fields like score or name by clicking the `+` icon.

Go to `Email` to edit the default message and reference fields. You can also [customize its style](/help/custom-emails#c6872760d8cb46d382efc4089b770e9a).

You can [personalize lead quiz notifications](/help/filter-branch-workflows#1530ee47667b80b5a331cff31ed5c22a) by sending custom emails depending on the score. First, add a `Branch` action to your workflow. `Edit` to set up conditional logic.

For example, if a lead scores less than 5, we’ll send them an email that includes an encouraging message with links to learning resources. Then, we’ll `+` add a different email branch for those who scores greater than or equal to 6.

<Tip>
  If you prefer to send formatted emails with custom styles, use Fillout’s [Sendgrid](/help/sendgrid) or [Mailchimp](/help/mailchimp) integrations.
</Tip>

## Add calculations to ending pages and custom emails

Fillout’s [calculations](/help/calculations) features let you add, subtract, multiply, divide, or assign values from quiz answers (e.g. suggesting a daily caloric intake based on a respondent’s weight, height, and exercise frequency).

Open `Logic` and click `Calculations` to add dynamic values to an ending page or respondent email.
