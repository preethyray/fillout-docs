## About Zoom

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) provides remote conferencing services, offering video conferencing, online meetings, chat, and mobile collaboration.

## Getting started

If you haven’t already, start by [creating a free Fillout account](https://build.fillout.com/signup?integration=linear).

### **1. Create a scheduling form**

On the Fillout **homepage**, click on the `Scheduling` tab on top followed by `+ Scheduling form`. Then, choose a **meeting type**.

</Frame>

Name your meeting, pick a duration and click `Create`.

<Note>
  If you haven’t yet connected to Google Calendar, you’ll be prompted to sign in with Google first, to schedule events directly on your calendar.
</Note>

### **2. Connect your Scheduling form to Zoom**

Once in the editor, on the left hand side, click `+ Add meeting location` and select `Zoom`. Then `Connect to Zoom`.

</Frame>

You’ll be prompted to grant access to create meetings automatically in your Zoom account (and also the option to edit those meetings if your clients choose to reschedule or cancel).

### **3. Publish and share**

Before finishing, you’ll have a default **Availability** schedule created in Fillout which you can edit in the settings, along with meeting buffer times, and more, if needed in the left hand side.

Click `Publish` in the top-right corner to get a publicly shareable link to your scheduling form, which is now automatically synced to your Google Calendar, and to your Zoom account.

## Schedule calls based on conditions

You can choose to only schedule calls with certain users, by sending them to different pages of your form depending on their answers, even automatically based on data like [company size and industry](/help/page-logic).

## Disconnect Zoom from Scheduling Forms

If you’d like to stop scheduling calls from your Scheduling form, you can click the `X` icon next to meeting location to remove it from your form. Remember to click `Publish` in the top-right corner again to make that change go live.
