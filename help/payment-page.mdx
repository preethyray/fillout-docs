## How to add a payment page

Click `+ Add page` and choose `Payment`.

<Check>
  **Good to know:** Payment pages are available on all plans with **no additional fees** charged to use the feature. However, usual Stripe fees such as transaction costs still apply.
</Check>

Select between the following types:

- **One-time** - for single, non-recurring transactions
- **Subscriptions** - for recurring transactions usually with a fixed price
- **Pay what you want** - leave the amount up to the customer

Add the details of your payment page and `Connect to Stripe`. From here you can choose the currency, and make the **price** and **product name** [dynamic](/help/fetch-dynamic-data) by clicking the blue `+` icon or typing `@` to reference a specific field.

In this example, the product name and price will change per customer depending on their order.

The default payment method in new forms is through a credit **card**. You can give more options to your customers by adding more **Payment methods** through the left-hand panel.

That’s it\! Press `Preview` to try out your form. Payments will only be collected when you `Publish` the form and send its link.

## Add discount codes

`Allow discount codes` in the left-hand panel and click `Manage discount codes in Stripe` to add a code or link an existing one to your form.

You can also choose a URL parameter or field as the **Discount code** when you scroll down to `Pre-fill fields`.

## Create a new Stripe customer

`Collect email` under **Payment**. This will automatically add an **email** field to your payment page and create a new customer on Stripe.

## Pre-fill fields

You can automatically fill out the fields of the payment form by toggling the `Pre-fill fields` switch. Then, select the corresponding fields below.

## Reference the payment intent ID in integrations

You can save the Stripe payment ID to the integration of your choice by referencing it. Go to **Integrate** and choose a platform. Under **Mappings**, look for **Stripe Payment ID.**

Stripe payment ids will look like pi_3MKECGFiethEjGwr1TWmQ0rN and allow you to tie a form submission to an actual payment in Stripe.

## Send a receipt upon successful purchase

Toggle `Send receipt` in the left-hand panel to automatically send the customer a receipt once they make a purchase.

The receipt will only be sent if you enable the `Collect email` switch as described above. Note that receipts are not sent in Fillout preview mode.

## Add a testimonial

You can increase checkout rates by putting a testimonial from a customer. Go to **Appearance i**n the left-hand panel and turn on the `Show testimonial` switch.
