## Common reasons to collect location coordinates

### Record the exact address of a respondent

Determine the approximate location of a buyer or business with latitude and longitude coordinates to improve your delivery or pickup service. Collecting a precise location reduces delays in shipment and increases customer satisfaction.

### Pinpoint the approximate location of an accident, crime, or other incident

Provide a more thorough report to hospitals and investigators to help identify possible suspects and causes, and prevent similar incidents from occurring again. This can also be helpful in filing for insurance claims.
