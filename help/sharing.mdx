### Embed Fillout forms on your website

Pick an embed option in the **Share** tab. You can embed it in four different ways:

- **Standard** - a block embed on your site, which can be controlled in height and width
- **Full screen** - an embed that takes up the entire screen
- **Popup** - an embed in a large popup on screen, opens the form by pressing a button
- **Slider** - in a sliding bar from either the left or the right side of the screen, opens the form by pressing a button

Click `Use this embed` and copy/paste the result into your website builder, or directly into your HTML code. That’s all\! Your forms should be ready to go.
