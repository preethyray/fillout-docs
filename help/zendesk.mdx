## What Zendesk is

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a customer service software company that provides a cloud-based customer support platform. This platform enables businesses to manage customer interactions across phone, chat, email, social media, and any other channel you can imagine, all in one place.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to Zendesk**

Open the form you want to `Integrate` with Zendesk. Then, enter your **Zendesk** subdomain.

More details on how to find your subdomain [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409381383578-Where-can-I-find-my-Zendesk-subdomain-).

### **2. Map your form fields**

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in Intercom for the new message. Make sure to include the contact's email, name, subject, and the ticket description.

### **3. Publish and share**

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. New form submissions will now create tickets directly in your Zendesk\!

Remember to click `Publish` after making any further changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/help/conditional-integration).
