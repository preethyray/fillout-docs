## How to send event reminders

On the Fillout dashboard, click [**Workflows**](/help/workflows) in the top menu. Select your preferred **Scheduling** workflow template.

</Frame>

Choose whether you want an **Event email reminder to host**, a **Slack reminder before calls** to yourself, or an **Event email reminder to invitee**.

`Create workflow` and select which form youâ€™d like to apply this workflow to. Alternatively, you may open an existing form and do the same in the **Integrate** page.

### **Event email reminder to host**

Send reminders to yourself before a meeting takes place. By default, reminders are sent 30 minutes before a calendar event. To change this, `Edit` how soon you prefer to send it **Before event starts**.

Reminders are sent to the email linked with your Fillout account by default. Send this to a different email or add another email for backup (or if there are multiple hosts) by clicking `Edit` under **Send email**, then `Recipients`. Simply type the email addresses under **Send to**.

### **Slack reminder before calls**

Send a Slack reminder 5 minutes before an event occurs. `Edit` this default time to how soon you would like to send it **Before event starts**.

Connect to **Slack** by clicking `Edit` and selecting the **Channel** you would like to send it to. You edit the message and add other preferred form fields by simply typing `@` and selecting them from the dropdown menu.

### **Event email reminder to invitees**

Remind invitees to attend calls before they occur via email. By default, this is sent 30 minutes before a call. Click `Edit` to change this to how soon you would like to send it **Before event starts**.

Setup invitees emails by clicking `Edit` in **Send email**. Make sure to turn off the `Self-email` switch in the upper right corner.

Under **Send to**, pick an email field in your form. You can change the **Subject**, add **Attachments**, and more under **Advanced.** To change the look of your email, check out this [quick guide](/help/custom-emails).

Remember to `Test` you workflow first through the upper right corner, and `Publish` it to enable the changes.
