After confirming a signature, respondents can still click on the `x` icon to remove the provided signature.

## Common signature workflows

### Validate authenticity of a submission

Request e-signatures for your online waivers, non-disclosure agreements, record verification forms, or any workflow that requires verifying the integrity of user-provided data. The signature field is often used to allow respondents to consent and attest to their submission.

### Streamline business processes

Increasingly, businesses are using e-signatures to approve employee documents, validate transactions, and kick off employee or vendor onboarding. One way to do this is in Fillout is to include relevant documents in your form with the [PDF Viewer](/help/embed-pdfs) field type. This way your respondents can view documents without leaving the form and add their signature with the signature field type.
