## What is form validation

**Data validation** in form building or simply **form validation** ensures that the responses matches certain predefined criteria before the form is submitted. This maintains the accuracy of the data and enhances security by avoiding the submission of incorrect, incomplete or harmful data.

## Set a validation rule

Click on the question or field followed by its `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel. Open the **Validation** dropdown and choose a `Validation pattern`.

### Validate with Regular Expressions

Choose **Regex** validate a form input with a regular expression, which definse a rule for the type of input you want to accept. See [here](https://digitalfortress.tech/tips/top-15-commonly-used-regex/) for a list of popular regular expressions. Here are some examples:

| Purpose | Regular expression |
| --- | --- |
| Whole numbers | ^\\d+$ |
| Alphanumeric without space | ^\[a-zA-Z0-9\]\*$ |
| Alphanumeric with space | ^\[a-zA-Z0-9 \]\*$ |
| URL | https?:\\/\\/(www\\.)?\[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%.*\\+~#=\]{2,256}\\.\[a-z\]{2,6}\\b(\[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%*\\+.~#()?&//=\]\*) |
| Decimal numbers | ^\\d\*\\.\\d+$ |
| Whole and decimal numbers | ^\\d\*(\\.\\d+)?$ |

Copy and paste one of the regular expressions above into the **Regex** field. Test your form using the `Preview` mode!
