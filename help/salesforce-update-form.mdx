If you don’t already have a Fillout account, you can [create one here](https://build.fillout.com/signup). Then, create a form and connect your Salesforce account.

## How it works

### **1. Set your form to update mode**

First, navigate to the **Integrate** tab and select `Salesforce`.

</Frame>

Then, click `Update record`.

### **2. Create a custom update link per record**

You'll now get a formula that defines a unique link for every record in your object. Add this new formula to your Salesforce object.

Go to your Salesforce dashboard and click the `settings icon` on the upper right side followed by `Open Advanced Setup`.

Using **Quick Find** on the left-panel, search for `Object Manager`. Click your `object`. In our example, we used Contact.

Go to `Fields & Relationships` and create a `New` field.

</Frame>

Select **Formula** from the list. Then, copy and paste the formula from your Fillout form into Salesforce.

### **3. Preview your form**

Complete your setup by clicking `Finish setup`. You can test your form in `Preview` mode or use one of the unique links to update a record once your form is live.

Your form will **automatically pre-fill** the data for the record it is updating.

<Note>
  If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
</Note>

## **Advanced next steps (optional)**

You can also enhance your update forms by integrating them with platforms like Salesforce App Builder or Lightning Experience. Instead of the formula in Step 3, you might consider using a `Button` field.

This button can then be embedded within Salesforce interfaces for users to easily manage records.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/help/conditional-integration).
