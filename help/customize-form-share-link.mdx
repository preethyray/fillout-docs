## Overview

Customizing your formâ€™s **link preview text** and **image** is an important way to optimize the shareability of your form. When you share your form on other sites or social media platforms, the **meta information** such as the title, description, and thumbnail play a crucial role in attracting users to click on your link.

## How to edit share preview

By default, your form's share preview shows the name of your form and a general description. To change this, click **Share** on top followed by **Customize link**.

Under **Change share preview**, click `Customize` to edit the **Title**, **Description**, and **Thumbnail**.

`Copy` your form link and paste it anywhere you'd like, such as a messaging app or website. Here's how our example looks like when sent in iMessage. Remember to `Publish` your form to make the latest changes reflect.
