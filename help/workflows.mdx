## How to create a workflow

Go to **Workflows** from the top menu to create a `+ Blank workflow`. Select which form you’d like to **apply the workflow to** in the dropdown menu. Then, choose a **trigger**.

</Frame>

Alternatively, you may open an existing form first or create a new one, then click **Integrate** on the top menu followed by `Workflows`.

**Workflow triggers**

A trigger refers to a condition that starts a specific action or series of actions. Examples are:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Form submitted" icon="square-check" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal="true">
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Form abandoned" icon="file-dashed-line" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduling event canceled" icon="calendar-xmark" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event rescheduled" icon="calendar-pen" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
  <Card title="Before event starts" icon="calendar-circle-exclamation" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
    
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Then, choose an **action** and `Edit` it according to your preferences. To add more actions, press the `+` icon.

**Workflow actions**

Actions are the tasks or steps that are automatically carried out after a trigger occurs. Examples are:

  <Card title="Run AI (Summarize, Classify, Generate, Extract)" icon="robot" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal="true" href="/help/ai-workflows">

  <Card title="Send Slack/Teams/Discord messages" icon="slack" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal="true">

## Test workflows with prior submissions

Test your workflows without waiting for triggers or creating demo submissions.

## 1-click automations with templates

The fastest way to get started with workflows is from a [template](https://build.fillout.com/home/workflows). These are common use cases for Fillout Workflows.

## Monitor workflows in one place

Easily track email notifications and other workflows, with full visibility of what happened when. To view workflow runs, open your form and go to **Integrate** from the top menu. Click the `clock icon`.

<Frame>

You can also [view a single form submission](/help/view-responses#3adbe1475f90474fb6b76d367700bb55) and click on the `Workflows` tab. The workflow run history shows when each step occurred and if there were any issues.

  **Good to know:** You can have as much as 5 different workflows in one form.
