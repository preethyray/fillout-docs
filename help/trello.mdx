## What Trello is

[Trello](https://trello.com/?ref=fillout-forms-help-article) is a tool that helps you organize tasks and projects using visual boards and lists. It allows team members to easily collaborate and manage their work.

## How it works

### **1. Link your Fillout form to Trello**

Open your Fillout form or create a new one. Navigate to the **Integrate** page and look for `Trello`.

</Frame>

### **2. Map your form fields**

First, select a **board** and a **list**. Reference the other fields by clicking the blue `+` icon or typing `@`. You can type a fixed **card title** and **card description**, if needed.

</Frame>

### **3. Publish and share**

Once your form’s all good, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`. Now, you’ll see a new card in your Trello board for every new form submission.

## Create issues based on conditions

You can choose to create certain types of issues when a condition is met. For example, create cards for different lists depending on what respondents specify in the form. More details [here](/help/conditional-integration).
