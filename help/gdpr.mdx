## What is GDPR?

The European Union’s [General Data Protection Regulation](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en), or **GDPR**, are data protection regulations built around the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights’ stipulation that EU citizens have the right to the protection of their personal data. In short, GDPR stipulates that you obtain consent before collecting personal data, that you give users their data and delete it if requested to do so, and that Europeans’ data is stored only inside the EU.

## Who does GDPR apply to?

GDPR applies to all businesses based in the EU, as well as all businesses that receive or process data from European residents. If your company is based in the EU, or if Europeans fill out your forms, GDPR may apply to your work.

## Is Fillout GDPR-compliant?

`Fillout complies with the GDPR framework.` Fillout is engineered to keep every user’s data private and secure and we have taken a number of measures to comply with GDPR.

**Privacy requests and exports**

You can export your data from Fillout at any time, including all form responses, to migrate data if needed. If you would like a copy of your account data, email [privacy@fillout.com](mailto:privacy@fillout.com). You can also request that Fillout remove form responses, if needed. Fillout will permanently delete forms, individual form responses, or your user data from our servers and backups, if deleted in Fillout or requested from [privacy@fillout.com](mailto:privacy@fillout.com), within 45 days.

If you are an EU resident and would like to make use of your GDPR data privacy rights, please contact [Plighter](https://prighter.com/q/11880772674), our privacy representative in the EU.

To obtain a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), [contact us](https://main.fillout.com/enterprise) to learn about our EU Enterprise plan.

**Security**

Fillout is hosted on the Google Cloud platform, via [Render.com](https://render.com/), with Google’s industry-leading security. Fillout encrypts all data in transit between you or your form respondents and Fillout’s servers over HTTPS/TLS. Data is also encrypted at rest and replicated for durability.

Fillout can also save your form data to third-party applications—and for Enterprise plans, can save data solely to external storage applications if you choose (i.e. your data is never stored on our servers). Be sure to check the app where you’re storing form data for their GDPR policies, including [Airtable](https://support.airtable.com/docs/gdpr-at-airtable), [Google Sheets](https://cloud.google.com/privacy/gdpr), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/gdpr-at-notion), [SmartSuite](https://www.smartsuite.com/security), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr), and [Monday.com](https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000733949-monday-com-and-GDPR).

- **Delete your Fillout account**: If you would like to close your Fillout account and delete all of your data stored at Fillout, contact Fillout at [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) or delete your account from the general settings to do so.

## How to build a GDPR-compliant form

Fillout is designed around GDPR-compliant privacy and security, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind when building forms to ensure that your forms and business are GDPR-compliant, too.

First, always make sure your form respondents consent to the collection of their data. Include a privacy notice at the bottom of your forms, something like “by submitting this form, you agree to the terms of our privacy policy” and link to your company’s privacy policy. Better yet, include a checkbox as a required field that contains your privacy policy, so you can guarantee that every respondent consciously accepted your policy. In your privacy policy, be sure to outline how respondents can request their data or its removal.

Then, if a respondent asks that you remove their data, delete it fully from both Fillout and any other app or service where you may have synced the data. If your form signed them up for an email newsletter, unsubscribe them and delete their data. Fillout will fully delete any backup data within 45 days from when you delete it in Fillout—but it’s your responsibility to ensure the data is deleted anywhere else you may have copied, synced, or saved it.

If your business needs to store all respondent data within the EU, get in touch with [Fillout’s Enterprise team](https://main.fillout.com/enterprise) to set up EU-based hosting, encryption with custom public/private keys, along with single sign-on, database integrations, and additional Enterprise-focused features.
