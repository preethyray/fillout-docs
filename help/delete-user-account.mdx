Please note that deleting your **Fillout** account **cannot be undone**. Account deletion will remove your entire [organization](/help/organizations), which includes [workspaces](/help/workspaces), forms, respondent submissions, collaborators' forms and unsubscribe you from email notifications.

<Note>
  Only the **account owner** can delete their own account and they have to downgrade first if they're on a paid plan.
