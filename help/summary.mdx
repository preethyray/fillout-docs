Answers are sorted by recency, with the most recent answers at the top. `Filter` responses based on answers or `Date range`.

If an answer catches your interest and you want to see the respondent's full submission, click `⋮` or the three vertical dots followed by `View response`.

Aside from their answers to other questions, you’ll see submission details like what type of browser they used and when they submitted your form. You can also [delete unnecessary submissions](/help/delete-a-form-submission) from here.

## Visualize your data

Fillout helps you spot trends across your survey results. Questions with repeated responses are summarized with a bar chart. Change the view by toggling the `Pie chart` switch.
