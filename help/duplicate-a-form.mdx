Duplicating an entire form can be useful if you want to keep all of your fields and just make a few adjustments, or make a new version of your form without updating the old one.

## How to duplicate a form

From the **homepage**, locate the form you want to duplicate and click `⋮` or the vertical ellipsis. Then, click `Duplicate`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/image-69.png" alt="Duplicate a form" />
</Frame>

That’s it! You will now have two identical forms, with different unique links.
