Duplicating an entire form can be useful if you want to keep all of your fields and just make a few adjustments, or make a new version of your form without updating the old one.

## How to duplicate a form

From the **homepage**, locate the form you want to duplicate and click `⋮` or the vertical ellipsis. Then, click `Duplicate`.
