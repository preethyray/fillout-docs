## What is Airtable

[**Airtable**](https://airtable.com/) is a cloud-based collaborative database and project management platform that combines the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the power of a database.

## Video tutorial

Check out this tutorial on using **Fillout** to create or update an Airtable base.

## How it works

### 1. Create your database in Airtable

<Note>
  If you already have your base created in Airtable, you can skip this step.
</Note>

Log in to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), and click `Add a base`.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Give your base a **name**, and create the **fields** you need. You’ll need one field for every question in your form (eg. Single line text for a short answer, Single select for radio buttons, Multi-select, etc).

<Frame>

</Frame>

If you are using the Select and Multi-select properties, make sure to type in the options you’d like people to choose from.

Once you’ve added a **field** (and options, when needed) for every response field in your form, 90% of your work is now done.

</Frame>

Nice work\! Now you’re ready to sync it easily with a new or existing Fillout form.

### 2. Connect your database to your form

In your [Fillout](https://build.fillout.com/home) dashboard, click `+ Make a Fillout` followed by `Connect` and choose Airtable.

</Frame>

Select your theme (don’t worry, you can always change this later). Then, enter your **Account name** and `Connect to Airtable`.

<Note>
  After connecting, you can switch to use [personal access tokens](https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-and-using-api-keys-and-access-tokens), as well, on the dashboard integrations tab.
</Note>

After making the selections, click `+ Create form`.

</Frame>

<Note>
  **Troubleshooting:** Don’t see your table in the dropdown list? Check you have connected to the correct base, and try refreshing the page or hitting the refresh icon.
</Note>

### 3. Map your questions

Fillout pulls questions and answer options from your Airtable base. Your `Airtable fields` now appear in the left sidebar. Simply drag & drop to build your form.

</Frame>

To connect a new question to your Airtable database, or check an existing connection, go to the dropdown menu inside **Connected \> Column to connect to** in the right sidebar.

<Tip>
 If you make changes in your Airtable base that you want to reflect in your Fillout form, hit the Refresh icon 🔄 , or refresh the Fillout page
</Tip>

### 4. Publish & Share

Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go\! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Airtable database.

<Check>
  **Good to know:** Fillout has many powerful features like [branching](/help/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/help/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/help/conditional-integration).
