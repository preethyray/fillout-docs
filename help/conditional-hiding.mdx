## What is conditional logic

**Conditional logic** is a dynamic feature that adjusts form content based on responses, creating a personalized experience and improving data accuracy.

## Hide a question based on a condition

Click on the question you want to hide followed by its `settings icon`. Then, open the **Logic** section on the right-hand panel to `Set conditional logic`.

Then, `+ Add condition`. You can make a condition based on:

- Previous form inputs
- URL parameters (e.g. source = Facebook or Google)
- Data from an integration
- Date information (e.g. 5 days from today)

For example, we’ll only ask users to specify if they need any special accommodations.

## Hide always

Toggle the `Hide always` switch to always hide a question or field. This is useful for [pre-filling questions](/help/prefill-fields) that you don’t want your users to change.
