### Referencing voice recordings

Both audio files and written transcriptions can be used in your preferred [integration](/help/integrations) when mapping fields. You can also set up [logic](/help/page-logic) to show only relevant pages based on your respondent's answers.

  **Good to know:** Respondents can listen to their voice recordings while filling out the form and view transcripts. They can also pause, delete, or make new recordings, and edit transcripts if needed.

## Mapping to Airtable, Notion and other databases

After adding a `Voice recording` field, head over to the **Integrate** page through the top menu. Then, select a database. In this example, we'll use Airtable.

Under **Mappings**, reference Airtable column fields from the left to Fillout form fields in the right. Look for your voice recording question, and choose between **Audio file** or **Transcription**.
