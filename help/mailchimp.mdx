## What Mailchimp is

  **Important:** When creating your form, make sure to set the email, name, and other fields you would like to link to your Mailchimp mailing list to **required**.
</Check>

Choose which **account** and **audience** you would like to create or update contacts in, then click `Continue`.

### 2. Map your form fields in **Fillout**

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your Mailchimp audience. For example, link the email address field by its respective question.

### 3. Publish and share

`Publish` your form once everythingâ€™s set. Answers from new submissions will now appear in your Mailchimp audience list. If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.

## Add tags

You can add Mailchimp tags to new contacts automatically to help segment your email audiences. `+ Add tag` and choose from the dropdown.

To add a tag to specific contacts, toggle the `Add contionally?` switch. `Set conditional logic` and choose when to apply it. For example, tagging users with their occupation.

Remember to click `Publish` on the upper right corner after making any changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/help/conditional-integration).
