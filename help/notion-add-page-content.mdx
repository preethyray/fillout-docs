## Overview

Fillout let you [add or update pages](/help/notion) in your Notion databases with modern forms, quizzes, or surveys. Typically, this means creating new entries in each column of your Notion database. However, you can also add content to the body of a Notion page.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your form">
    If you haven’t yet created your form, follow the steps in [this article](/help/notion) to connect a Fillout form to Notion to create or edit pages.

  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Page content section">

    Click `Integrate` in the top menu and choose `Notion`. Here, you’ll find the option to reference information in your form, to create personalized content for your Notion page.

    </Frame>

  In the example above, we inserted the user’s name, and their favorite Notion feature, in a survey we ran, as well as a helpful link. Simply click the blue `+` icon or type `@` to insert answers to your form fields.

  <Note>
    For more information on referencing information (answer piping), see [this help article](/help/answer-piping).
  </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Style your text and publish">

      You can **highlight any text** in this section to style it before you’re ready to add it to your Notion page.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/Screenshot2025-05-16at4.19.25PM.png" alt="Screenshot of the Form designer tab of a form" />
      </Frame>

      That’s it\! `Publish` your form, and then share the link directly or embed it on your site.
