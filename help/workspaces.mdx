## Create a workspace

On the **Home** screen, click `+` or the plus symbol on the left side, then enter the name your workspace.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/account/image-17.png" alt="Create a workspace" />
</Frame>

You’ll now be redirected to your new **workspace**, which can also be accessed on the left-hand panel.

## Add a form to a workspace

Click `⋮` or the three vertical dots of a form and select `Move to workspace`. Then, choose the workspace you’d like to add the form to.

</Frame>

Alternatively, you can drag and drop a form to your preferred workspace.
