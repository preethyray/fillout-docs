You can toggle `Include a link to edit submission` to allow your respondents to revise their answers later on.

That's it\! Respondents will now automatically receive an email notification upon submission containing a summary of their responses like the one below.

  **Important:** Make sure you have an **Email Address** field in your form so that Fillout knows where to send the respondent email to.

## Tailor messages depending on the response

You can send a different message to a group of respondents depending on the answers they have provided in the form through **Custom emails** under **Settings**.

Choose `Send email only if conditions match`. Set your [conditions](/help/custom-emails#c00fb6fd8e2d4b169e36f4dd9a7ae029). Then, click `Save changes` when you're all set.

## Send email to multiple recipients

You can also send your email to multiple recipients at once by toggling `Self-email notifications` and adding their email addresses.
