## What ActiveCampaign is

[**ActiveCampaign**](https://www.fillout.com/integrations/activecampaign) is a platform for email marketing and lead nurturing, enabling businesses to automate personalized communications and targeted campaigns for effective customer engagement and conversion optimization.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to ActiveCampaign

Open the form you want to **Integrate** with ActiveCampaign.

  **Important:** When creating your form, make sure to set the email, name, and other fields you would like to link to your ActiveCampaign list to **required**.

Enter your **API URL** and **API Key** from ActiveCampaign into Fillout. Go to the link in the banner to learn how to find these. Then, select a **List** in ActiveCampaign you’d like to connect to.

### 2. Map your form fields

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your ActiveCampaign list. For example, link the email address to its respective field.

You can use other **Fields**, such as name, number, and more in your form to update your contacts' details.

### 3. Publish and share

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. After publishing, answers to mapped fields from new submissions will appear in your ActiveCampaign list. If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.

## How to add tags

You can add ActiveCampaign tags to new contacts automatically to help group your newsletter audiences. `+ Add tag` and choose from the dropdown.

To add a tag to specific contacts, toggle the `Add contionally?` switch. `Set conditional logic` and choose when to apply it. For example, we'll add the New tag when a customer hasn't been part of our waitlist before.

Remember to click `Publish` after making any changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. More info [here](/conditional-integration).
