## What is Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/fillout/integrations) lets you connect an app to 2,000\+ other web services. Automated connections called **Zaps**, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

## How to link Fillout to Zapier

First, log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new account. Then, hover over the left-hand panel and click `Apps`.
