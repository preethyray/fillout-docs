Add a file upload field type to your Fillout form to collect files or attachments of any kind. Restrict to certain file types or maximum file sizes.

## How to add a file upload field

First, [create a new form](https://build.fillout.com/) or choose an existing Fillout form. Then, drag the `File uploader` field onto your form.

## Size limitations

On the **Free, Starter,** and **Pro** plans, individual file uploads can be `up to 20 MB per file` and there is no restriction on total files uploaded, as long as usage is within our [fair use policy](/fair-use-policy). On the **Business** plan, file uploads can be `up to 1 GB per file`. All plans allow unlimited file uploads.

## Restrict file types and number of files

Click the field type followed by its `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel . Here you can restrict the number of files your respondents can upload.

You can also restrict uploads to certain file types under the **Advanced** section, like PDF, mp4, png, and other types.

## Viewing uploaded files

You can view uploaded files from any submission on the Fillout [results tab](/results).

If you prefer, integrate your form with [Dropbox](/dropbox) or [Google Drive](/google-drive) to send all file uploads to a specific directory in Dropbox/Google Drive.
