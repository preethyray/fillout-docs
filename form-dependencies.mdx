## Overview

One of the biggest risks of using no-code tools like Airtable, Notion and Salesforce is outages from unexpected schema changes. For example, you might delete a field in Airtable but forget to update a downstream tool that relies on that field.

To mitigate this problem, Fillout offers a **dependency tracker**, a single view of which external fields all of your forms rely on.

### What are external dependencies

**External dependencies** are additional components or libraries that are not inherently part of the form builder dashboard but are utilized to enhance or extend its functionality. These are 3rd-party integrations used in your forms like Airtable databases.

<Note>
  **Note:** This feature is only available on Fillout's [Enterprise plan](https://fillout.com/enterprise).

## How to view dependencies

On the homepage, click your **Name** in the bottom right corner followed by `Fillout Enterprise`. Navigate to **Form dependencies** on the top menu. Here, you’ll see a list of every external field that your forms relies on.
