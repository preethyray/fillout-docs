## What Zendesk is

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a customer service software company that provides a cloud-based customer support platform. This platform enables businesses to manage customer interactions across phone, chat, email, social media, and any other channel you can imagine, all in one place.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Zendesk

Open the form you want to `Integrate` with Zendesk. Then, enter your **Zendesk** subdomain.

More details on how to find your subdomain [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409381383578-Where-can-I-find-my-Zendesk-subdomain-).

### 2. Map your form fields

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in Intercom for the new message. Make sure to include the contact's email, name, subject, and the ticket description.

### 3. Publish and share

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. New form submissions will now create tickets directly in your Zendesk\!

Remember to click `Publish` after making any further changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
