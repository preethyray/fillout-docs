## What is React

[**React**](https://react.dev/?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications efficiently. It provides a modular and declarative approach to building UI components, facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

## How it works

Embedding Fillout forms in a custom-built React app can be a great way to get refined control over how the forms are displayed on your site. You’ll also be able to define custom button designs for embeds like popups and sliders. To start embedding, simply add the `@fillout/react` npm library to your React project, and then select what kind of embed you’d like to use.

For example, embed with a popup embed using either a standard button or a custom one:
