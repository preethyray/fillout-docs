## What Google Docs is

[**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) is a cloud-based word processing tool that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time from any device. Part of Google Workspace, its known for its ease of use, seamless collaboration features, and integration with other Google services.

## How it works

### 1. Link your form to Google

Open your Fillout form or create a new one. Under **Integrate** from the top menu, click `Google Docs`. Then, `Sign in with Google` to authorize access.

Choose which **Folder** you’d like to store submissions in. Then, type a **File name** or reference fields in your form by clicking `+` or typing `@`.

You can choose to customize the format of the Google Docs by clicking `Custom message` to only include relevant fields. Type keywords and reference fields using the `+` icon. To format the text, highlight it.

Then, click `Finish setup` in the upper right corner.

### 3. Publish and share your form

`Preview` your form to test it out. Once everything’s set, click `Publish` and share the link or embed your form anywhere.

That’s it\! Now every time a form is submitted, a new Google Doc will appear in your chosen folder.
