## How to insert a table

On the left-hand panel, look for the `Table` field. Click `+ Add column` to ask a question or request for information.

Choose from 5 different field types: short answer, email input, date picker, dropdown, and number. The email input field will only accept valid email addresses.

Reorder the columns by dragging them in the right-hand panel.

<Note>
  **Note:** Connecting the table field to an [integration]() is currently not supported. However, responses can be viewed in a modal on the Results page.

You can also reference the table field by typing `@` and selecting it from the choices.

### The difference between a table from a choice matrix

With a **table**, you can add different types of question fields, such as text, numbers, or dropdowns. In contrast, a [**choice matrix**](/matrix) is limited to using only radio buttons for tasks like rating, comparing, or selecting options within a grid.
