### **What is OneDrive**

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/onedrive-for-business?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is a cloud storage service that allows users to store, share, and access files from anywhere. With seamless integration across devices and robust security features, it provides a convenient solution for storing and collaborating on documents, photos, and more.

## How it works

### 1. Connect your Fillout form to OneDrive

Go to **Integrate** and select `OneDrive`.

`Connect to OneDrive` and enter the login credentials of your Microsoft account. Choose a `Folder` you would like respondents to upload their files to.

<Note>
  **Note:** This integration can only be linked to Microsoft organizations, work and school accounts, not personal accounts.
</Note>

### 2. Map your form fields on Fillout

Under **Upload fields**, click `+ Add new` followed by a file uploader, voice recording, or PDF field.

### 3. Publish and share

Click `Finish setup` followed by `Publish` on the upper right corner, and you're all set\!

## Add a dynamic file path

You can categorize file uploads into folders based on your respondents’ answers. Toggle the `Custom subfolder and file name?` switch, then enter a name or click the `+` icon to reference a field as the **Subfolder name**.
