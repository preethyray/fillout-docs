## What Attio is

[**Attio**](https://attio.com/?ref=fillout) is a CRM platform that adapts to different business needs, effectively managing sales, customer relationships, and data. It stands out for its ease of use, strong data integration, and focus on security.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Attio

Open the Fillout form you want to connect with Attio, then go to **Integrate** in the top menu. Click `Attio` to link your form to an object.

</Frame>

Enter a `Name` for your Attio connection, and click `Connect to Attio`. You will be prompted to grant access to a workspace of your choice.

Lastly, select an **Object** you’d like to sync form responses to.

</Frame>

<Note>
  **Note:** You can connect your Attio form to any object in your workspace.

### 2. Map your form fields on **Fillout**

You can map your Fillout fields to your Attio attributes either by dragging them from the left-hand side when editing your form.

</Frame>

Alternatively, you can click `Edit` on your Attio connection in the **Integrate** page and do **Mappings** there. `+ Add new` and match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding attributes in your Attio object.

<Frame style={{ width: '624px', height: '119px' }}>

</Frame>

Select the Attio attributes in the left dropdown and map it to the relevant Fillout field or question in the right dropwdown.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can click the **refresh** icon on the right side to have the most recent changes reflect in **Mappings**.
</Tip>

### 3. Publish and share

`Publish` your form. Now, answers to matched fields will appear in the attributes of your record on Attio.

## Updating existing records

If you’d like to update existing records that already exist, just toggle `Update if record already exists?`. Then choose which attribute you’d like to use to determine the record to update.
