## Overview

While [Webflow](https://webflow.com) has some built-in form features, they have limited multi-step functionality and only work with a limited number of third-party apps and platforms, making it hard to sync data to your CRM, database, or email marketing platform.

## How to embed your form in Webflow

Start by clicking `Publish` in the upper right corner of the Fillout form editor. Next, open the **Share** tab from the top menu.

Select your preferred embed style and click `Use this embed`. Adjust your embed style settings to fit your use case (more info [here]()) and click `Get the code`.

Open your Webflow visual editor, click the `+` symbol on the upper left corner (or press `A`) to open the **Add Elements** sidebar.

Select the **Elements** tab, scroll to the **Advanced** section at the bottom of the list, and drag and drop the `Embed` to a spot on the page.

Paste your **embed code** from Fillout into the code editor and click `Save & Close`.

The Webflow visual editor doesn’t display scripts, so you need to open the **Publish** menu in the upper right corner of the screen and click `Publish to selected domains`. After publishing the changes, click the `external link icon` next to your site URL (an arrow pointing to the upper right corner) to confirm that the embed works as intended.

## Troubleshooting common issues

Sometimes, design settings applied in Fillout cause the embed to show up as too narrow on the page. To fix this manually, select the `Embed` in the visual editor, then open the **Size** menu from the right **Style** sidebar.

Increase the `Min W` value, publish the changes, and keep adjusting until you find a value you like (500px is a good starting point).

Floating buttons (available in the **Popup** and **Slider** embed settings) may float behind certain elements and styles, like image sliders.

One way to fix this is placing the `Embed` element inside of a `Div` block (under **Basic** in the **Add Elements** sidebar) – almost anywhere on the page should work – and selecting `Relative` from the **Position** dropdown in the right **Style** sidebar.

Then, click on every `Slide` element on the page and select `Static` from the **Position** dropdown within the **Style** sidebar.
