## How it works

### 1. Create a payment form

Click `Make a Fillout` on your home page followed by `Payment`. Next, `Connect to Stripe`.

Alternatively, you may create a `Form`, and add a `Payment` page in it. See [this guide](/payment-page) for more information.

### 2. Edit the product details

Click `Edit product`, and change the details as you see fit.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can toggle the test mode switch on the upper right side of your Stripe account to preview the payment form without needing to make a payment.
</Tip>

### 4. Connect the form to an Airtable

Go to **Integrate** in the top menu and click `Airtable`. Next, connect to your Airtable account and choose a [base and table](/airtable).

### 5. Map Airtable columns to form payment fields

Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new`. Then, click `Pick reference` to check the payment fields. Go to your Airtable base, and create one column per payment field.

### 6. Publish and share your form

That’s it\! Click `Publish` and share the link or embed it on your website. You’ll now get a new row filled out every time someone completes a purchase.
