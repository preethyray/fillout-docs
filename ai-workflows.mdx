## How to use AI

Go to the **Workflows** page and click `+ Blank workflow`. Choose which form you’d like to **apply the workflow to** in the dropdown menu. Then, select a [trigger]() followed by an `AI action`.

## Types of AI actions

Choose between the four types of **Actions** below:

**Summarize text**

Get a summary of the form submission or a specific set of answers by clicking `Custom` and referencing fields. Click the `+` icon or type `@`.

**Extract information**

Easily get only the information you prefer to know by referencing a specific **Text to extract info from**. Click the `+` icon or type `@` to choose a field or question. Input the information you’re looking for in the **Outputs** field.

Once you’re all set, `Test` your form, then `Publish` it.
