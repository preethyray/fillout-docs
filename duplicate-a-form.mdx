Duplicating an entire form can be useful if you want to keep all of your fields and just make a few adjustments, or make a new version of your form without updating the old one.

## How to duplicate a form

From the **homepage**, locate the form you want to duplicate and click `⋮` or the vertical ellipsis. Then, click `Duplicate`.

<Frame style={{ width: '336px' , height: '231px' }}>
  ![Duplicate a form](/images/guides/image-69.png)
</Frame>

That’s it\! You will now have two identical forms, with different unique links.
