  **Good to know:** You can map URL or Email fields to the **Company Domain** property, and it will extract the domain name. For example, [alfie@sola.com](mailto:alfie@sola.com) will be recorded as [sola.com](http://sola.com) in HubSpot.

Click `Finish setup` in the upper right corner once everything is good, and `Publish` your form.
