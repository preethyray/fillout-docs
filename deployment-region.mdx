## Overview

**Deployment region**Â refers to the ability to choose where your form submission data is stored and processed, typically for compliance, security, or performance reasons. This feature is available for enterprise users, allowing them to select specific geographic regions to meet data residency requirements, enhance privacy, and ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA).

## Change deployment region

On the **homepage**, click your **account name** in the bottom right corner followed by `Settings & Members`. Then, click `General` and `Edit` it to your preferred region.

Currently, there are two available regions to choose from, United States and Europe. However, you can request a new region. Form submissions received prior to making the switch will automatically be transferred to the new region.

<Note>
  **Note:** Only Admin users of Enterprise workspaces can change the deployment region.
