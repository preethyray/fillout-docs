## How to create a template

First, navigate to the **Share** tab of the form you’d like to turn into a template.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Go to **Template** and toggle on `Share as template` and provide the required fields. This information will be displayed alongside your template, but you can change it at any time.

Choose the **Visibility** of your template.

- **Public** templates will be viewable and cloneable by members outside your organization.
- **Private** templates will only be viewable and cloneable by users on your Fillout account.

Click `Create template` and that’s it\!

Look for the **Template** tag to tell which of your forms are templates.

## Public templates

Public templates get an automatically generated landing page, like [this one](https://www.fillout.com/templates/flower-order-form), that you can share with anyone.

Contact [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) if you’d like your template to be visible in the **Template Gallery**.
