## What is a Meta Pixel

A [**Meta Pixel**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153?id=1205376682832142) lets you track user behavior, like when a user opens a webpage. You can add tracking pixels on Facebook business accounts, and then use them in your **Fillout** forms\!

## How to use pixels in your form

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Meta Business Manager (formerly Facebook Ads Manager)

Head over to **Integrate**, and click `Facebook Pixel`.

Input your **Pixel ID**. Follow the instructions below to find your ID. Then, click `Finish setup`.

### 2. Publish and share your form

That's it\! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner. When someone submits your form with your public form link, you will get events in your Events Manager, which look like the image below.

## How to check event details

If you click on one of the **Fillout events** which are generated, which would either be **Fillout.FormPageViewed** or **Fillout.FormSubmitted**, you will be able to `View details`.

In **Recent activities**, you can see parameters that were passed to the pixel.

- **content_category** - the form unique ID
- **value** - the page ID that the user saw, which you can find in your editor in the URL at the top (e.g. https://app.fillout.com/editor/85jZPR1kPsus/edit/85jZPR1kPsus, means that the form ID is 85jZPR1kPsus, and the page you are looking at has an ID of 85jZPR1kPsus)

<Note>
  **Note:** It can take up between 2 to 5 minutes for new events to show up in your Events Manager. So, if you're not seeing events from a newly connected form, wait for a little while and double-check that you're using the correct pixel id.
</Note>

If you need to be GDPR compliant, you will want to display a cookie banner on the form, which can be toggled in the form settings.
