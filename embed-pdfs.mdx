## How to display PDFs within your form

Click on the sample PDF copy, followed by the `settings` icon. The right hand-panel will show where you can **upload** your PDF file or add a **link** to it. You can also change the size of the PDF on your form by editing the **max height**.

You can also [conditionally hide](/conditional-hiding) your PDF to only let it appear based on a respondent's choices through **Logic**.

<Note>
  **Note:** Files larger than 10MB cannot be uploaded, but can be added as a **link**.

## Benefits of embedding PDFs

### Support your form with relevant documents, portfolios, reports, and more

Attaching a PDF to your form allows you to provide more information about your form's purpose or content. For example, an interior designer attaching her work portfolio to a client inquiry form gives the respondent a better understanding of their service and expertise.

### Add consent forms, terms of service, and other types of agreements

Let respondents view copies of agreements in your form to give them the information they need. You can also ask for their e-signatures on the same survey or form with **Fillout**'s [**signature field type**](/esignatures).
