## Overview

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com) released form blocks, and their logic features and results tracking aren’t as powerful as those that come with a dedicated form builder.

There are three basic ways to embed a Fillout form in WordPress:

- Add a Fillout Form URL to an Embed block using the Visual editor
- Add a Fillout embed code to a Custom HTML block using the Visual editor
- Add a Fillout embed code to your page’s HTML code using the Code editor

## Add a Fillout Form URL to an Embed block

First, `Publish` your form and then head to the **Share** tab. Copy the URL from the `Form Link` field.

In WordPress, open the page where you want to embed the form. Click the `+` symbol in the upper left corner of the page editor to open the **Block Inserter** in the left side (or press Ctrl \+ Alt \+ Y to insert a block below your cursor’s current position) and search for the `Embed` block.

Paste the `Form Link` from your Form’s **Share** tab into the block’s text field and click `Embed`.

This is the quickest and easiest way to embed a Fillout form in a WordPress website. But it’s also the most limited in terms of design and layout. You have limited control over the block’s size and positioning on the page.

## Add a Fillout embed code to a Custom HTML block

The best way to add a Fillout form to your WordPress website is by using one of the embed codes since it gives you more control over the layout and often looks better on the page than using the `Form Link`.

After publishing your form, open the **Share** tab. Select your preferred embed style (Standard, Full screen, Popup, or Slider) and click `Use this embed`. Then, adjust your embed style settings to fit your use case (more info [here]()) and click `Get the code`.

On the WordPress page where you want to embed the form, click the `+` symbol in the upper left corner of the page editor to open the **Block Inserter** in the left side (or press Ctrl \+ Alt \+ Y to insert a block below your cursor’s current position) and search for the `Custom HTML` block.

Paste the embed code from your Form’s **Share** tab into the block’s text field and click `Update`.

## Add a Fillout embed code to your page’s HTML code

If you want or need to see all of a page’s HTML before adding your embed code, you need to switch to WordPress’s **Code editor**. This will help you make granular adjustments or troubleshoot code or style-related issues.

After publishing your form, open the **Share** tab. Select your preferred embed style (Standard, Full screen, Popup, or Slider) and click `Use this embed`. Adjust your embed style settings to fit your use case (more info [here]()) and click `Get the code`.

<Frame style={{ width: '240px' , height: '349px' }}>

In WordPress, use the visual editor to open the page where you want to embed your form. Click the three vertical dots in the upper right corner of the screen, followed by `Code Editor` (or press Ctrl\+Shift\+Alt\+M from anywhere in the visual editor).

Paste the embed code from your Form’s **Share** tab into the block’s text field and click `Update`.
