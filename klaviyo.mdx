## What Klaviyo is

[Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) is an e-commerce marketing platform that helps businesses manage and optimize their email and SMS marketing efforts to drive sales and customer engagement.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Klaviyo

Open your form, then go to **Integrate** and click `Klaviyo`.

Enter your **Private API Key**. Click the link in the banner to get redirected to the page containing the key. `Create Private API Key` in the new tab. Enter a **name** and choose `Full Access Key`.

Then, select a **List** in Klaviyo you’d like to connect to.

### 2. Map your form fields on Fillout

Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your Klaviyo audience. For example, link the email address to its respective field.

You can use other **Fields**, such as name, number, address, and more in your form to update your contacts' details.

### 3. Publish and share

Once everything is set, click `Finish setup`. After publishing, answers to mapped fields from new submissions will appear in your Klaviyo audience list. If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.

## Add custom properties

You can add extra metadata using other fields in your form using the same steps above. For example, we'll match Special diet to the Do you or any of your guests have dietary preferences?
