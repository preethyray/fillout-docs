## What Relay.app is

[Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is a tool that lets you automate workflows across different apps, with the option to involve a human in the process. Each automation is called a **Workflow**, which consists of a **trigger**, an action that kicks off your workflow, and **steps**, which are actions performed after a trigger.

## How it works

### ******1. Connect your Relay.app with Fillout******

Sign up or log in to your [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) account. On the left-hand panel, click `Apps` to `Connect` your Fillout account.

### **2. Create a workflow**

Go back to the home page, and, click `+ New workflow` in the left side. Then, `+ Add trigger` and search for **Fillout.** Click `New submission`.

Next, select a Fillout **Form** in the dropdown menu. Then, `+ Add step` to select an action. Choose between apps, webhooks, AI, and more.

Use `Human in the loop` to ask for approval or input from a team member via email or Slack message. More info [here](https://www.relay.app/features/human-in-the-loop).

### **3. Test your automation**

`Start a test run`, and choose a form submission from the list in the pop-up.
