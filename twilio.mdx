## What is Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is a cloud communications platform that enables businesses to integrate SMS, voice calls, video conferencing, and email across multiple channels into their applications via APIs. It lets users create solutions for customer support, marketing, security notifications, and more.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Twilio

On your form builder dashboard, head over to **Integrate** in the top menu, and look for `Twilio`.

<Note>
  **Note:** You must set up a virtual phone number in Twilio to be able to send and receive SMS messages.
</Note>

Enter your **Twilio Account SID** and **Twilio Auth Token**. You will find both in your **Account Dashboard** under **Account Info**. Then, select a **Phone Number** from the dropdown menu.

### 2. Map Fillout form fields

Select the **Recipient phone number** field, and add your message. Reference contact details, order specifics, and other form fields by clicking `+` or simply typing `@`, and clicking the field.

`Finish setup` and test your form via `Preview` mode in the upper right corner.

### 3. Publish and share your form

Once everything’s set `Publish` and share your form link or embed it on a website. That’s it\! Now, every time someone completes your form, a message will be sent to them.

## Specify a condition

You can choose to send a message only under certain conditions. Read this quick [guide](/conditional-integration).
