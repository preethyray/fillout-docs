## What SmartSuite is

[**SmartSuite**](https://www.smartsuite.com/about-us) is a team-oriented work management platform that empowers groups to organize, monitor, and oversee workflows, projects, and daily assignments efficiently. It provides a centralized solution for planning and overseeing all your team's tasks and projects.

## How it works

### 1. Connect to your SmartSuite account

Head to the **Integrate** tab from the top menu, and select `SmartSuite`.

Input your SmartSuite **API key** and **Workspace ID**. You can find your **API key** in your user profile, and your **workspace ID** as the first 8 characters after https://app.smartsuite.com when you’re logged in.

Refer to the [SmartSuite help center](https://help.smartsuite.com/en/articles/6096587-retrieving-your-api-key-and-workspace-id) for more info on how to find these.

### 2. Pick your Solution and App to connect the form to

They should be the one you’d like records to be either created or updated in.

You can also connect existing questions by clicking their `settings icon` and using the **Connected** menu in the right-hand panel. More info [here](/additional-integration-mappings).

  **Good to know:** Fillout has many powerful features like [branching](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.
