## What is form abandonment

**Form abandonment** occurs when respondents start filling out a form but exit before reaching the last page. When respondents abandon forms, it indicates a lost opportunity for capturing valuable leads or completing transactions. Addressing your [page drop-off rate](/analytics) is crucial for improving overall conversion rates, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing business outcomes.

## Remind respondents to complete form submissions

On your form's **Settings**, click `Conversion kit` in the left side. Choose whether you would like to send an email or a Slack message if a form is abandoned.

The default time frame for a message to be sent is 30 minutes after the form is abandoned. To change this, `Edit` your **Form abandoned** [trigger](#99220f0b85ea4660b748aeb000bc23f9).

`Edit` the content of your **Send email** action. You can also add attachments, copy colleagues, and more under **Advanced**. More info [here](/custom-emails#09b881b02dbe4151a49c7d3f1fb13f8b).

`Test` your workflow through the upper right corner, then hit `Publish` when youâ€™re good with it. Respondents will now receive a link to their [partial submission](/partial-submissions), allowing them to continue their submission on any device.

To edit this workflow, go to **Integrate** from the top menu.

### Send Slack message

`Edit` Slack [action]() to connect your Fillout account to your Slack workspace.

Select a **channel**. This will automatically send a response summary in a formatted message. You can also opt to customize the [message](/slack#ef26e6ec904741dca5e8c88cf910549d).

## Receive notifications when a respondent abandons your form

Toggle the `Self-email` notifications switch. The email linked to your Fillout account serves as the default receiving address. This can be changed by clicking `x` to delete it and inputting the preferred receiving address.
