## What is a group meeting

Group scheduling allows multiple participants to join the same call hosted by a single person. This is ideal for webinars, courses, and other group events.

## How to set up

### 1. Connect your calendar

Click `Scheduling` in the top menu of the homepage followed by `Calendars and apps`. `+ Connect calendar` and log in to your Google Account.

You can also customize avatars or use a generic image such as a company logo for the event to maintain brand consistency by clicking the avatar on the form or by going to the `Booking page`.

That’s it\! Your scheduling link is now ready to go. `Preview` then `Publish` your form, and send the link or embed it anywhere.

## Set the maximum attendee limit

In the left-hand panel, add your preferred number of **Max attendees per event**.
