Alternatively, you can click `+ Make a Fillout` on the **homepage** followed by `Templates`.

That’s it\! You now have access to that form on your account. Make any changes you need, [customize it](/styling), [connect an integration](/integrations), and [publish your form]() once you’re good to go.

## Make your own template

You can even make your own template from one of your forms and share it inside or outside of your organization. More details [here](/make-a-form-template).
