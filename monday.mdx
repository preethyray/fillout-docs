## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Monday

Open the Fillout form you want to connect with Monday, then go to **Integrate** and click `Monday`.

</Frame>

<Note>
  **Note:** When creating your form, make sure to set necessary fields you would like to link to your Monday columns to **required**.
</Note>

Enter a `Name` for your Monday connection and your Monday `API Key`. Follow the instructions below to locate your **API Key**.

Choose the **Workspace** and **Board** you would like to sync responses to.

### 2. Map your form fields on **Fillout**

Under **Mappings**, `+ Add new`. Match the fields in your Fillout form to the corresponding columns in your Monday table.

Select the column you want to map in the `Monday field` dropdown. In the example below, we will link the name of the referrer to the respective column.

</Frame>

<Tip>
  **Tip:** You can click the **refresh** icon on the right side to have the most recent changes reflect in **Mappings**.
</Tip>

### 3. Publish and share

`Publish` your form. Now, answers to matched fields will appear in the columns of your table on Monday.

## How to integrate without mapping

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Monday

Follow the same steps above to connect your **Fillout** form to a Monday table until you have chosen a **Workspace** and **Board**.

</Frame>

### 2. Drag and drop synced column fields

`Edit` your form and go to the **existing** **page** where you asked for input you want to be synced to your table or create a new page. In our example, we'll edit the Referral's Details page.

On the left-hand panel, you will see `Monday columns` synced from your chosen table.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Drag and drop the necessary **column fields** to your page. For example, we'll remove the Name field and replace it with the Applicant column field. You can edit the text as you see fit.

<Note>
  **Note:** You can only use a **column field** once. For example, if you used column field A in page 2, you can no longer use it in other pages.
</Note>

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
