### 2. Add your questions
  Drag and drop the quiz questions you'd like to use from the left-hand panel to your form. Select from dozens of different types.

  Put a `tick mark` on the correct answer. You can choose multiple correct answers, if applicable, and even define a score value for each answer. Typically, you’ll want to assign a score of 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect answers, but you can use different values if you’d like to weigh questions unequally.

  You can also enable [email notifications](/email-notifications) for whenever someone fills out your quiz. The respondent’s score will be included in the email.

### 6. Review and analyze results

  **Fillout** provides real-time reporting and analytics on your quiz results. You can view individual responses or analyze trends and patterns to gain insights into your audience's knowledge and understanding. Just click on the **Results** tab to get started.

## Advanced quiz features

### Accessing the respondent’s score in the quiz

You can [reference](/answer-piping) the respondent’s score anywhere in the quiz, even while the quiz is still in progress. Use this to set up conditional logic (like showing [different pages](/page-logic) to people who score differently) or to [show or hide](/conditional-hiding) fields dynamically.

Type `@` anywhere and select `Score`.
