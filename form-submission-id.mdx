A unique **Submission ID** is generated whenever someone begins to complete your form. Submission ID’s are randomly generated, like 6bcedd3a-fe26-4bcb-9ce9-d3850e38d42c.

## Send the submission ID to your integration

### 1. Select your integration

First, navigate to **Integrate** tab located on the top menu, and choose the app or service you would like to use.

### 2. Map Submission ID on your Fillout form

Under **Mappings**, `+ Add new`. Then, choose what field you want to save the Submission ID to and select `Submission ID`from the dropdown on the right-hand side.

In this example, we’re going to save the Submission ID to a field called Fillout Submission ID in our Airtable base. Click `Finish setup` in the upper right corner. That’s it\! The Submission ID will now be saved to your integration.

<Note>
  **Note:** If you’re using Zapier or Make, you’ll also see the option to reference the Submission ID.

## Finding a submission on the results page
