## Overview

The **Analytics** section displays various metrics about your form, like completion rate, number of submissions, total views per page, and more. You can also see how many completed submissions your forms are receiving per day.

## How to view analytics

Open a form and navigate to the **Results** page. Click `Analytics`.

- **Started** - number of times your form was started but left incomplete
- **Finished** - number of times your form has been fully completed
- **Completion rate** - number of finished submissions divided by started submissions
