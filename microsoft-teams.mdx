## What Microsoft Teams is

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is an all-in-one tool for teamwork, combining messaging, meetings, and file sharing in a single place for easy collaboration. Whether it's chatting, video calls, or sharing documents, Teams makes working together effortless.

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Teams

Navigate to the **Integrate** page, and click `Microsoft Teams`.

</Frame>

You will be redirected to Microsoft's log in page. Sign in with your account to continue, then click `Accept` to allow Fillout to send notifications to your channels in Teams.

### 2. Choose a channel

Select a **Team** followed by a **Channel** where you want notifications to be sent to.

</Frame>

That's it\! Every time a respondent completes your form, a notification will be sent to your Teams channel.

## Message formatting

### Send all fields (recommended)

By default, form submissions will be sent in a nicely summarized format to your chosen channel.

Edit the default message and choose which fields will appear in your Teams notification. Reference fields in your form by clicking the `+` button or typing `@`.
