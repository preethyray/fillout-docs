## Overview

When a respondent closes or exits a form, Fillout saves their progress so they can return later. Upon reopening, a pop-up lets them choose to resume or start over.

## How to continue answering a form

Respondents can simply visit the same link to pick up where they left off. If the form is embedded, they can continue on the same site. They can return as often as needed until the form is submitted.

<Note>
  **Note:** Partial submissions are not available to respondents on private browser windows, like Incognito mode on Google Chrome. They should also use the same browser and device to resume form submissions. To resume submissions across devices, use a [**form portal**](https://www.fillout.com/form-portal).
</Note>

## How to view partial submissions

On the **Results** page, you can view responses from respondents who abandoned or havenâ€™t finished their submissions under `In Progress`. This helps you retain valuable data and re-engage prospects who dropped off

You can also [filter submissions](/view-responses#17d0ee47667b80f8a40be8b05885b25f) in progress. To learn more about navigating the Results section, click through [**here**](/view-responses).

<Note>
  **Note:** Viewing partial responses is only available to Business and Enterprise plans. Click [**here**](https://www.fillout.com/pricing) to see our pricing plans. However, respondents who answer Fillout forms can continue submissions where they left off on any pricing plan.
