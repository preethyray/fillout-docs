## Overview

Fillout lets you [create update forms](/airtable-update-form) to update existing records in Airtable, SmartSuite, Notion and other databases. By default, however, Fillout requires you to pass in the record ID to update in the URL. With the approach described below, you can have your users `choose which record they would like to update`.

## How it works

### 1. Create an “update” form

Follow the steps [here](/airtable-update-form) to create an “update” form. Make sure to select `Update record` on the integration and to publish the form.

### 2. Create another form to choose the record

Create another form. This is the main form you will send your respondents to so that they can choose the record to update.

In the form, add a linked record picker that links to the Airtable you would like to update. For example, if your first form updates a Product Inventory table, create this form tied to a different table that has a linked relation with Product Inventory. In this form, add a record picker to choose from those products:

### 3. Connect the forms together

Navigate to the [ending page](/ending-page) of your record chooser form and set your update form as the **New form to redirect to**.

Finally, pass the record ID to update the update form. Click `Set URL parameters` to choose the `ID` parameter of your update form and map it to your record picker field’s `Record ID`.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** If you don’t want to create records in your first form, you can always [set a condition](/conditional-integration) for when the integration is run (set a condition that is never true).
</Tip>

That’s it\! You can now send respondents to your picker form to choose a record. Once they submit that form, they’ll be automatically redirected to the update form, which will be pre-filled with the record they chose.
