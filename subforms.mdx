## Overview

Create nested forms and collect repeated data, like multiple individuals or products. Organize and structure long forms by breaking them down into smaller subforms.

## How to use a subform within your form

On the left-hand panel of your form, click `Subform`. Then, type the question or information you need from your respondents.

Click the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel. Next, select a **Connected Subform** to link to another form. This linked form will appear for respondents to fill out when they complete the subform question or field. Lastly, select a **Main field**. This will be the label of the subform.

That's it! `Publish` your form and share the link. Subforms allow respondents to edit completed submissions and resume partial ones.

## Add subform limits

`Require minimum submissions` from respondents by toggling this option under **Validations** on the right-hand panel. Here, you can also `Limit maximum submissions` to put a cap on the number of subforms they can add.

## Select from previous submissions

You can also allow respondents to pre-fill form fields with existing form records by adding a `Submission picker` field. View the quick guide [here](/submission-picker).
