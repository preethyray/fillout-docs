## How it works

By default, Fillout emails the form creator when a meeting is booked, and Google Calendar sends the respondent a meeting invite with details.

If youâ€™d like to also personally email your respondent, you can add a [custom followup email](/custom-emails) in your form **Settings** from the top menu. Click `Notifications` in the left side followed by **Custom emails**.

Choose the `Thank you email` workflow and `Edit` your message. More details [here](/custom-emails).
