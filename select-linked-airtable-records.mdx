## Video tutorial

In Fillout, you can even filter which records a user is choosing from. Here's how.

## **Let users choose from a filtered set of Airtable records**

To get started, click `+` followed by `Link to another record` field in your Airtable table that you plan to write or update.

Now, go ahead and drag and drop that field into the Fillout form editor, and you'll immediately be able to pick from records in that associated table.

Now, you can customize this field with many options like:

- Allow users to create new entries in a new (customizable) form
- Allow selecting multiple linked records
- Select which fields to show (can show images\!)
- Limit to a view
- Pick which field to search by
- Filter which records to show based on form inputs or dynamic data
- And many more\!
