  ## Launch Week Day 5 of 5 ✨ Document generation & PDF to Form

  Welcome to the last day of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii). Thanks for following along\!

  We've saved the **biggest update for last**. Fillout now has native PDF and document generation features, plus an AI-powered tool to turn your PDFs into online forms. Here's how it works:

  #### ✨ PDF to Form

  Try out the upgraded [PDF to Form tool](https://www.fillout.com/pdf-to-form). Upload a PDF or document with question fields to get started. The new tool is much faster and doesn't limit the size of your PDF.

  Plus, Fillout generates a form that **automatically fills your PDF** each time a new submission is received.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 43 01PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.43.01PM.png)

  #### 📝 PDF workflows on existing forms

  You can add multiple PDF workflows to existing forms, too.

  Head to the integrations tab and choose [Generate PDF](https://www.fillout.com/pdf-to-form). Then, map your form fields to any part of the document.

  You can even map checkboxes, signatures and non-question fields.

  notion image

  You'll get a link to each filled document on the Fillout results page.

  #### 📧 Send filled PDFs by email

  Include a copy of the generated PDF in your respondent and self notification emails.

  #### ⚡️ Upload filled PDFs to 3rd party apps

  You can automatically upload generated documents to 3rd party apps, like Airtable, Notion, SmartSuite, GoogleSheets, Dropbox, and more.

  #### ⬇️ Let users download their PDF

  Add a "Download PDF" button to your form to let respondents download the finalized PDF document after their submission.

  ## Launch Week Day 4 ✨ Voice input & transcribe with AI

  Welcome to Day 4 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  Today we're introducing a new way to collect input in Fillout: **voice**. Voice is a convenient way to collect responses for long-answer inputs or data collection in the field.

  Plus, with recent advances in AI, you get [accurate transcriptions](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii) almost instantly, powered by OpenAI and Azure.

  #### 🎙️ Voice recording field

  To get started, add a [voice recording field](https://www.fillout.com/help/voice-recording) to your form.

  Your users will be prompted to record a message, along with the option to pause, resume, finish and restart their recording.

  The voice recording field is available on all plans, including the [free tier](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 27 20PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.27.20PM.png)

  #### 📝 Transcribe with AI (Business)

  Enable transcription to automatically generate a transcript of every recording.

  Provide a [custom prompt](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii) to tailor the transcription style to your needs.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 27 31PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.27.31PM.png)

  Transcriptions are powered by OpenAI's Whisper, hosted in the US or EU (Azure) depending on your plan.

  #### ✅ Send recordings and transcripts to 3rd party integrations

  Send the raw audio file and/or transcription to your 3rd party services. For example, upload recordings to Dropbox, Airtable or even use them in Zapier/Make/Relay automations.

  ## Launch Week Day 3 ✨ Free REST API, 3rd party apps & integration tools

  Welcome to Day 3 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  Today we released major upgrades to Fillout's developer features and tools to manage 3rd party integrations.

  #### 🤖 REST API is now free

  The Fillout [REST API](https://www.fillout.com/help/fillout-rest-api) lets you access your form responses programmatically, without using the Fillout site.

  It's now available on all plans, including the free tier.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 22 44PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.22.44PM.png)

  #### 🙋‍♂️ View integration usage

  On the Fillout integrations page, click "View usage" to see which of your forms are connected to each 3rd party service.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 23 01PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.23.01PM.png)

  #### ✅ API improvements

  Return responses before/after a certain date, fetch in progress submissions, sort responses and even obtain an edit link for any form submission.

  We've also improved the response format to make it easier to work with.

  #### 🔒 Restrict integrations by workspace (Enterprise)

  Limit who in your organization can access each of your 3rd party accounts. Set permission boundaries across teams or different clients.

  #### 🔄 Build 3rd party apps (OAuth)

  Create apps that integrate with Fillout accounts.

  Third party apps let you or your users access Fillout responses via API. Once someone grants access to your application, you'll have API access to fetch forms, responses and even create webhooks. Learn more here.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 23 12PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.23.12PM.png)

  #### ⚡️ Our first OAuth integration: Relay

  [Relay](https://www.fillout.com/help/relay-app) is our new favorite tool for human-in-the-loop and AI-assisted automations.

  They recently released a Fillout integration with our new 3rd party app framework.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 23 28PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.23.28PM.png)

  ## Launch Week Day 2 ✨ Subforms and Submission Pickers

  Welcome to Day 2 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  Today we're introducing two powerful new field types to Fillout: the Subform and Submission picker.

  These advanced fields enable a new set of data collection use cases.

  #### 🔍 Subform

  [Subforms](https://www.fillout.com/help/subforms) make it easy to collect repeated information in your forms.

  For example, say you need your users to tell you about each of their family members.

  With a subform, respondents can add as many family members as they need. Each entry opens its own [customizable Fillout form](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 26PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.26PM.png)

  The subform also lets users [edit and resume](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii) in-progress submissions.

  #### ✅ Validation options

  Limit the number of subform responses your users can add with validation settings.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 38PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.38PM.png)

  #### **🔄 Submission picker field**

  This field lets respondents [select from previous submissions](https://www.fillout.com/help/submission-picker) of any Fillout form, without the need for a 3rd party integration.

  You can even use the selected submission to pre-fill fields or dynamically show/hide parts of your form.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 45PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.45PM.png)

  #### 👀 Filter which submissions are visible

  Lastly, set filters that determine which submissions a user can choose from.

  For example, only allow users to select their own past form submissions by matching on their login email.

  That's all for today\! Stay tuned for the next Launch Week update tomorrow on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fillout) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/filloutcom).

  #### 💻 Resume submissions across devices

  Adding a login page to your form automatically lets respondents continue form submissions across devices, like a phone and laptop.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 15 09PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.15.09PM.png)

  Optionally restrict respondents to 1 form submission per email address. A custom screen is shown to users who already completed your form.

  #### 📧 Verify email addresses and "remembered" login

  If your respondents submit multiple Fillout forms, they'll only need to verify their email on their first submission.

  #### 📝 Let users edit past submissions

  Enable editing past submissions to let your users see and update any of their prior responses, even across devices.

  ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 15 23PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.15.23PM.png)

  #### 🔐 Single Sign-On (Enterprise)

  Add Microsoft, OneLogin, Google Workspaces, Okta and other types of SSO login to your form. Optionally pre-fill fields with custom SSO attributes. Learn more [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/sso-form-login).

  #### ✅ Limit submissions to specific domains

  For internal-facing forms, limit submissions to only your company domain.
