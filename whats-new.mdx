  ## Launch Week Day 5 of 5 ✨ Document generation & PDF to Form

  Welcome to the last day of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii). Thanks for following along\!

  We've saved the **biggest update for last**. Fillout now has native PDF and document generation features, plus an AI-powered tool to turn your PDFs into online forms. Here's how it works:

  #### ✨ PDF to Form

  Try out the upgraded [PDF to Form tool](https://www.fillout.com/pdf-to-form). Upload a PDF or document with question fields to get started. The new tool is much faster and doesn't limit the size of your PDF.

  Plus, Fillout generates a form that **automatically fills your PDF** each time a new submission is received.

  You can add multiple PDF workflows to existing forms, too.

  Head to the integrations tab and choose [Generate PDF](https://www.fillout.com/pdf-to-form). Then, map your form fields to any part of the document.

  You can even map checkboxes, signatures and non-question fields.

  #### ✅ API improvements

  Return responses before/after a certain date, fetch in progress submissions, sort responses and even obtain an edit link for any form submission.

  We've also improved the response format to make it easier to work with.

  #### 🔒 Restrict integrations by workspace (Enterprise)

  Limit who in your organization can access each of your 3rd party accounts. Set permission boundaries across teams or different clients.

  #### 🔄 Build 3rd party apps (OAuth)

  Create apps that integrate with Fillout accounts.

  Third party apps let you or your users access Fillout responses via API. Once someone grants access to your application, you'll have API access to fetch forms, responses and even create webhooks. Learn more here.

  ## Launch Week Day 2 ✨ Subforms and Submission Pickers

  Welcome to Day 2 of Fillout [Launch Week](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).

  Today we're introducing two powerful new field types to Fillout: the Subform and Submission picker.

  These advanced fields enable a new set of data collection use cases.

  #### 🔍 Subform

  [Subforms](/subforms) make it easy to collect repeated information in your forms.

  For example, say you need your users to tell you about each of their family members.

  With a subform, respondents can add as many family members as they need. Each entry opens its own [customizable Fillout form](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii).
  <Frame>
    ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 26PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.26PM.png)
  </Frame>
  The subform also lets users [edit and resume](https://www.fillout.com/blog/launch-week-ii) in-progress submissions.

  #### ✅ Validation options

  Limit the number of subform responses your users can add with validation settings.
  <Frame>
    ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 38PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.38PM.png)
  </Frame>
  #### **🔄 Submission picker field**

  This field lets respondents [select from previous submissions](/submission-picker) of any Fillout form, without the need for a 3rd party integration.

  You can even use the selected submission to pre-fill fields or dynamically show/hide parts of your form.
  <Frame>
    ![Screenshot2025 04 23at4 18 45PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at4.18.45PM.png)
  </Frame>
  #### 👀 Filter which submissions are visible

  Lastly, set filters that determine which submissions a user can choose from.

  For example, only allow users to select their own past form submissions by matching on their login email.

  That's all for today\! Stay tuned for the next Launch Week update tomorrow on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fillout) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/filloutcom).

  Today's theme is Login 2.0. Adding the upgraded [login page](/login-page) to your form is more than just a way to verify email addresses. It also streamlines a lot of data intake workflows - more details below\!

  #### 🚫 Limit users to 1 response per email

  Optionally restrict respondents to 1 form submission per email address. A custom screen is shown to users who already completed your form.

  #### 📧 Verify email addresses and "remembered" login

  The login page now lets you verify email addresses, without connecting to a 3rd party integration.

  If your respondents submit multiple Fillout forms, they'll only need to verify their email on their first submission.

  #### 📝 Let users edit past submissions

  Enable editing past submissions to let your users see and update any of their prior responses, even across devices.

  Add Microsoft, OneLogin, Google Workspaces, Okta and other types of SSO login to your form. Optionally pre-fill fields with custom SSO attributes. Learn more [here](/sso-form-login).

  #### ✅ Limit submissions to specific domains

  For internal-facing forms, limit submissions to only your company domain.
