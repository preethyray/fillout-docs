Then, choose a **Main field**. Click `Publish` in the upper right corner and share your form link.

This main field is the label displayed for each submission from the list of records respondents can choose from. Be sure to choose a field that contains unique input like names and emails.

**Important:** Adding a submission picker to your form will grant public access to the submissions from whichever form you select. To restrict who can access the submissions, protect your form withÂ a [login page](/login-page).

You can also let respondents create new entries even when this feature is enabled. Simply toggle the `Can create new entries?` switch.
