If you don’t already have a Fillout account, you can [create one here](https://build.fillout.com/signup). Then, create a form and connect your Salesforce account.

## How it works

### 1. Set your form to update mode

First, navigate to the **Integrate** tab and select `Salesforce`.

Then, click `Update record`.

### 2. Create a custom update link per record

You'll now get a formula that defines a unique link for every record in your object. Add this new formula to your Salesforce object.

</Frame>

Go to your Salesforce dashboard and click the `settings icon` on the upper right side followed by `Open Advanced Setup`.

<Frame style={{ width: '288px', height: '271px' }}>

</Frame>

Using **Quick Find** on the left-panel, search for `Object Manager`. Click your `object`. In our example, we used Contact.

</Frame>

Go to `Fields & Relationships` and create a `New` field.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Select **Formula** from the list. Then, copy and paste the formula from your Fillout form into Salesforce.

### 3. Preview your form

Complete your setup by clicking `Finish setup`. You can test your form in `Preview` mode or use one of the unique links to update a record once your form is live.

Your form will **automatically pre-fill** the data for the record it is updating.

<Note>
  **Note:** If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
</Note>

## Advanced next steps (optional)

You can also enhance your update forms by integrating them with platforms like Salesforce App Builder or Lightning Experience. Instead of the formula in Step 3, you might consider using a `Button` field.

This button can then be embedded within Salesforce interfaces for users to easily manage records.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
