## What is SSO

**Single Sign-On** (SSO) is a user authentication service that allows a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. It enhances user experience by eliminating the need for password authentication for each application.

**Fillout** supports adding SSO login to your forms with Microsoft, Okta, OneLogin, Google Workspaces and other SAML providers.

- **Pre-fill fields** and add conditional logic based on your SSO user data
- Let users save and continue their forms later on, even from a different device
- Restrict form access to departments or roles

<Note>
  **Note:** SSO login is available on the [Enterprise Tier 2 Plan](https://www.fillout.com/enterprise).

## Setup process

First, [configure your single sign-on provider](/saml-sso) with Fillout. Next, add a [login page](/login-page) to your form. Select the `SSO` option as the **Verification type**.

</Frame>

That’s it - your form is now secured with your single sign-on provider. When a user submits a form, the results page will automatically show you which user submitted the form.

## Pre-filling fields and conditional logic

You can access the logged-in SSO user anywhere in Fillout, like in [default values](/prefill-fields) or [branching logic](/page-logic).

<Frame style={{ width: '336px' , height: '226px' }}>
  ![](/images/advanced/image-13.png)
</Frame>

For example, you can pre-fill questions like “Which department are you in?” with the department stored in your SSO provider.
