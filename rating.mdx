Click on the question or statement followed by the `settings` icon to customize it in the right-hand panel.

If you decide to use a different type of rating field, you can quickly change it by clicking on the `â‡„` or the double arrow icon under the settings icon.

## The difference between rating and ranking

Although similar, rating and ranking accomplish different goals. Rating questions are used to compare different options using a numeric scale. For example, asking product users how effective a vitamin C serum is in fading dark spots. Conversely, [ranking](/ranking) questions are used to determine how strongly or weakly a respondent feels with items on a list. For example, asking respondents to rank their most and least favorite movie genre.
