### What is REST API

A **REST API** simplifies interaction with your form data, allowing for automation and integration. Following RESTful principles, it seamlessly connects to retrieve, create, and modify form data.

### Introduction

The **Fillout API** lets you access information about your Fillout account programmatically, without using the Fillout site. The Fillout API is primarily for Fillout users and for 3rd party developers that want to build services on top of Fillout or access their submission data.

You can access a list of all your forms and the submissions for each form via the API.

### Authentication

Generate and view your API key in the `Developer` [settings tab of your account](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/developer). You can revoke or regenerate your API key at any time via the dashboard.

To authenticate your requests, you need to provide your API key in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-api-key>` with the **API key** obtained from your Fillout account.

You can obtain your API base URL in the API dashboard. Typically, it will be [https://api.fillout.com](https://api.fillout.com/).

  **Important:** If you’re self-hosting Fillout or using the EU agent, a different URL will appear in the dashboard.

<Info>
  **Note:** you can also use access tokens granted via a Fillout 3rd party integration. If you’re looking to build an integration, see [this article](/oauth-applications).
