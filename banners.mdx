## How to add a banner to your form

On the left-hand panel of your form, select `Banner` or drag and drop the field anywhere on your form.

  **Note:** This help article does **not** refer to header banners, but rather to banners you can add in your form's body.

Click the `settings icon` to change its color and icon. The right-hand panel will appear where you can select the appropriate banner type.

## Show banners only when necessary

Click the banner’s `settings icon`. Under **Logic**, `Set conditional logic`.

`+ Add condition` to select the relevant question and answer. For this example, we will show the warning banner only when guests are interested in swimming.

Take note that default is set to `Show when` and **equals**, which means a banner will appear when a certain option is selected. Alternatively, you can [**conditionally hide fields**](/conditional-hiding) and [**add condition groups**](/condition-logic-groups).

## Where you can use a form banner

### Inform respondents of policies, rules, and potential dangers

Banners are a great way to call attention to crucial information and relevant to what a guest or participant will be doing. This gives respondents a better idea of what to expect out of their experience.

### Excite customers and clients with exclusive deals and new features

You can use a banner to draw a respondent’s focus to a particular service or subscription.
