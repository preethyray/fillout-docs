## What is round robin scheduling

Round robin scheduling allocates appointments among hosts based on availability and priorities, ensuring each host gets equal opportunities and preventing any single host from being overloaded.

Icons will indicate who has successfully connected their calendars under `Settings & Members`. Click your `Account icon` on the lower left corner of the home page to access this.

### 2. Create the scheduling form

Click `Scheduling links` on the left-hand panel followed by `+ Scheduling form`. Choose `Round robin` and select which team members will participate.

### 3. Configure event details

Set the **Title** and **Event duration**. You can also customize avatars or use a generic image such as a company logo for the event to maintain brand consistency in the `Booking page` from left-hand panel, or simply hover over it.

That's it\! `Publish` your form and share the link or embed it anywhere.

## Manage Priority and Availability

### Priority Settings

You can assign priority levels to participants to control the distribution of appointments. Higher priority members are more likely to receive bookings if multiple participants are available at the same time.

### Automatic Assignment

Filloutâ€™s round robin algorithm assigns appointments based on the last scheduled participant to ensure even distribution, provided all conditions of priority and availability are met.

### Adjusting Locations and Meeting Details

Define one **meeting location** or set specific locations or meeting settings for each participant. Choose between Google Meet, Zoom, and more.
