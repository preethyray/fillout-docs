## About Linear

[Linear](https://linear.app/?ref=fillout-forms-helparticle) lets you easily create and manage issues, sprints and product roadmaps. It streamlines your workflow with a fast, intuitive interface designed for modern teams.

## Getting started

If you haven’t already, start by [creating a free Fillout account](https://build.fillout.com/signup?integration=linear).

## How it works

### 1. Link your Fillout form to Linear

On a Fillout form, head to the **Integrate** tab and look for `Linear`. Then, enter your **account name** to connect.

### 2. Configure new issue settings

First, select a **Team**. Reference any fields in your form by clicking the blue `+` icon or typing `@`. You can type a fixed text for the I**ssue title** and **Issue description,** if needed.

Optionally select the **priority**, **status**, and **project** to create the Linear issue with.

### 3. Publish and share

Once you’re ready, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner and publish your form. Now, you’ll see a new issue created in your Linear workspace every time someone completes your form.

Remember to click `Publish` after making any further changes.

## Create issues based on conditions

You can choose to create certain types of issues only when a condition is met. For example, create issues in different projects depending on what respondents specify in the form. More details [here](/conditional-integration).
