## How to add a date range

In the left-hand panel of your form, drag and drop the `Date range` field. This lets respondents select **start** and **end** dates in your forms.

You can customize the date format, first day of the week, placeholders, minimum and maximum dates and more on the right-hand panel. To edit, click your **date range question** followed by its `settings icon`.

## Mapping to Airtable, Notion and other databases

First, connect to your chosen database in the **Integrate** tab. Then, go back to **Edit**. Look for the `Date range` question type under **Other** and drag this to your form.

Go back to **Integrate** in the top menu to edit your connection.
