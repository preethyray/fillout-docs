## Update connections (if necessary)

If you're importing a form that has a connection to Airtable, Notion or another integration, find them in the **Integrate** tab. For each integration, click on `+ Connect new account`.

Then, select a **Base** and **Table**. Refresh the connection under if needed **Mappings** to your integration if some fields are missing or if the table isn't showing up by clicking `↻`.

You won't need to set up the field mappings again, just select a new connection.
