## How to validate business emails

First, add an `Email` field to your form and click the `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel settings. Head to the **Enrich** section.

Toggle `Disallow free email accounts` to block free email accounts, like @yahoo.com, @gmail.com, and @hotmail.com, from proceeding in your form.

Toggle `Validate email address` to only allow valid emails to be submitted. Fillout calls a third party service to check if the email is valid. This helps prevent typos, like if someone types jeff@amazon.co instead of jeff@amazon.com.

You can also `Send verification code` to send OTPs to emails or phone numbers. Check out the guide [here](/email-sms-otp).

Validation rules are enforced when respondent tries to proceed to the next page.
