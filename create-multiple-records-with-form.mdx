## Create new linked records with a subform

If you want the respondent to choose how many linked records they would like to create, enable `Can create new records` on the linked record picker. More details [here](/create-new-linked-records).

You can **fully customize** the form that appears for adding the linked records.

## Combine multiple forms together

You can combine multiple **Fillout** forms into one form using this [feature](/combine-and-repeat-forms). Your respondents wonâ€™t know they are filling out multiple forms. You can pass information between forms using URL parameters.

For organizational purposes, you can organize your forms together on the home page using [workspaces](/workspaces).

## Repeat a form

Let users choose to restart the form with a `Fill again` button or automatically redirect the user to the start of the form using the `URL button`. Both are found in the **Ending** page on the left-hand panel. More details [here](/combine-and-repeat-forms).

## Use the Webhook integration (Advanced)

You can always use the [Webhook](/webhook) integration to connect to Make or Zapier to create multiple records. We recommend using the other approaches, since those are easier to setup.
