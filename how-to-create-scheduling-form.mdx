## Overview

You can create a Fillout Scheduling form in two ways: as a [standalone form](/how-to-create-scheduling-form#4c264962c0d7497896d359066dd28748) from the Scheduling tab or by adding a [Scheduling page](/scheduling-page) to an existing form alongside other fields or questions.

Each form allows one meeting length. To offer multiple options, create separate forms for each type and share them individually or use [page logic](/page-logic) to guide respondents to the right [scheduling page](/scheduling-page).

### Create a standalone Fillout Scheduling form

Click the `Scheduling` tab in the top toolbar of Fillout’s dashboard followed by the `+ Scheduling Form` button.

Choose an [event type](/event-types). Then, add a meeting **Title** and **Event duration** or enter a custom meeting length in minutes. You can also set a default **Meeting location** for an in-person or phone meeting, or add a video call link to your meetings.

You can customize your form in the left-hand panel with the following settings:

- **General** - change your [event type](/event-types), edit the title, choose an event duration, and add a meeting location
- **Availability** - choose a calendar, [set your working hours](/fillout-scheduling-availability) (9AM-5PM, Monday to Friday by default), add a minimum notice period, set a buffer before and after events in minutes, and limit bookings per day
- **Notifications** - send a customizable automated email reminder
- **Advanced** - customize Google Calendar event details, time increments, and share link

Your scheduling form will automatically collect the invitee’s name and email. To add more fields, navigate to the `Booking page`. Here, you’ll also be able to customize your avatar, description, and more in the left-hand panel.

Then, name your Scheduling form. Click `Publish` to share the link of your scheduling form.

By default, your Scheduling form includes a date and time **Schedule** page and a **Confirmation** page to thank respondents for their booking, which can also be customized. You can even collect more information and add a [Stripe-powered payment page](/payment-page). Simply `+ Add page` at the bottom to add these.

### Add a Scheduling page to a standard Fillout form

Fillout’s core form editor also includes an option to add a Scheduling form page to any form. Open an existing form, and click `+ Add Page` at the bottom followed by `Scheduling`. Choose the `Scheduling with Google Calendar` option.

You’ll get the same functionalities as in standalone Fillout Scheduling forms, inside your multi-page form with your other existing Fillout form questions.

Or, if you already use Calendly or Cal.com, you can select them and [add your existing scheduling form to Fillout](/scheduling-page).
