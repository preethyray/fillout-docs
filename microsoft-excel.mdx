## What Excel is

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) is a powerful spreadsheet software that enables users to organize, analyze, and visualize data using functions, formulas, and charts. Part of the Microsoft 365 suite, Excel is widely used for tasks ranging from simple calculations to complex financial modeling and data analysis.

## How it works

### 1. Connect your Fillout form to Excel

Head to the **Integrate** page form the top menu, and click `Excel`.

</Frame>

You will be redirected to Microsoft's log in page. Sign in, and click `Accept` to allow Fillout to create a new sheet that will automatically be populated with form responses.

### 2. View the new sheet

Click `this sheet` to open the sheet linked to your form. Every question or field you add to your form will automatically become a column in your sheet.

### 3. Publish and share your form

That's it\! Once you're done with the set up, you're good to go. Click `Publish` on the upper right corner, then share your form. Every time someone submits your form, a new row will be created with their answers.

## **Specify a condition**

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [**guide**](/conditional-integration).
