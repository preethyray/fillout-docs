Fillout is designed for intaking data securely. We follow industry best practices to keep your responses secure and are `SOC 2 Type 2 compliant`. This certification verifies that Fillout meets rigorous standards for security, availability, and confidentiality in our data handling and processing systems.

This Security Practices page describes the administrative, technical and physical controls applicable to Fillout. If you have additional questions regarding security, please contact [security@fillout.com](/) and we will respond as soon as possible.

## Security features

In addition to following industry best practices, Fillout offers a number of security-focused features as additional safeguards.

- Fillout offers an option to only store form responses in external databases, like Airtable, Notion, SmartSuite and others, instead of storing data in Fillout.
- Fillout supports SSO providers, like Okta, Active Directory, or other SAML providers.

## Data we collect and store

See our [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).

## Infrastructure and network security

Security is a non-negotiable priority at Fillout. We take the following measures to keep your data and account secure.

### Hosting

Fillout is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS, via Render.com) and our AWS/Render servers are located in the United States and in the European Union (EU). EU servers are only used if requested by the customer. AWS data centers have state-of-the-art physical access controls, logical access controls, and frequent third-party independent audits. AWS has published a detailed security whitepaper outlining these measures.

Fillout employees have as-needed access to infrastructure on Render. All employees have dedicated user accounts and access infrastructure via two-factor authentication.

### Encryption

All `data in transit is encrypted` over HTTPS/TLS between you and Fillout's servers. All data is `encrypted at rest` and replicated for durability.

## Application security

### Two-factor authentication and single sign-on

Fillout supports G Suite SSO, allowing customers to enforce that users sign in using customer-managed identity providers. Two-factor authentication for application login can be enforced at the identity provider level (e.g. by turning it on within G Suite).

[Contact us](https://forms.fillout.com/t/sKWfR8LJnous) to enable other SSO providers, like Okta, Active Directory, or other SAML providers.

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

### Business Continuity

Fillout keeps daily and point-in-time encrypted backups of data on render.com. While never expected, in the case of production data loss, we are able to restore customer data from these backups.

### Disaster Recovery

In the event of a region-wide outage, Fillout will bring up a duplicate environment in a different AWS Platform region. Fillout infrastructure is designed to be portable and restorable under different regions.

### How to report vulnerabilities

You can email [security@fillout.com](/) with details on any security vulnerabilities you discover. Fillout operates a security bug bounty program. Security researchers around the world continuously test the security of the Fillout services, and report issues via the program.
