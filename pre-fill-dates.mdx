## How to pre-fill dates in your form

Drag and drop a `Date picker` or `Date time picker` field from the left-hand panel. Click the field followed by its `settings icon` to open the right-hand panel.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Under **Default value**, click `+` to add a reference. Then, click the `date icon` on the left side of the pop-up followed by your chosen option. In this example, we'll select Today.

<Frame style={{ width: '336px' , height: '253px' }}>

</Frame>

That's it! Respondents will now see the current date automatically, based on when they fill out the form.

<Note>
  **Note:** Respondents will still be able to change the date even if you have set a default value.

You can also type a certain date using the format YYYY-MM-DD.
