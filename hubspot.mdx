## How it works

### 1. Create your form in Fillout

In your [Fillout](https://build.fillout.com/home) dashboard, click `+ Make a Fillout` followed by `Connect` and choose HubSpot.

Choose your theme (donâ€™t worry, you can always change this later). Then, choose a **HubSpot** **account** to connect your contacts table to Fillout.

<Note>
  **Troubleshooting:** Unable to connect? Try ensuring that youâ€™re logged into your HubSpot account before connecting, and try again. Contact [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) for help.
</Note>

### 2. Map your questions

Fillout will pull your questions (and answer options, when present) directly from your HubSpot table. Your `HubSpot properties` will now appear in the left sidebar of your Fillout form editor. Simply drag & drop to start building your form.

To connect a new question or field to your HubSpot contacts, or check an existing connection, click the `settings icon` to open the right sidebar. Click **Connected** to view the **Property to connect to**.

Custom properties created in HubSpot should be marked toÂ **Use in forms, and bots**, to use in Fillout forms.

<Tip>
  **Tip:** To update your Fillout form with changes from your HubSpot contacts table, click the Refresh HubSpot Connection icon ðŸ”„ or refresh the page.
</Tip>

### 3. Publish & Share

Once youâ€™ve finished creating your form, youâ€™re ready to go\! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your HubSpot table. You can [share the link directly, or embed the form on your site](/sharing).

  **Good to know:** Fillout has many powerful features like [**branching**](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, thereâ€™s a way to build it in Fillout.

## Update existing contacts

Existing contacts will automatically be updated if the form is re-submitted with the same email as an existing contact in your HubSpot CRM.

  **Good to know**: You can pre-fill your form if you already know information about your existing contact. For more info, see this [help article](/prefill-fields).

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).

## Removing HubSpot integration

Go to the homepage and click your **account name** in the lower left corner followed by `Integrations`. Hover over HubSpot connection and click `â‹®` or the vertical ellipsis to `Delete` it.

In HubSpot, you can remove the Fillout connection from the [connected apps settings](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/connect-apps-to-hubspot). This won't affect your HubSpot data or Fillout submissions, and you can reconnect anytime from the `Integrate` tab.
