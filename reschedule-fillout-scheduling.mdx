## How it works

Each Fillout Scheduling meeting invitation in Google Calendar will include the names of the meeting participants, along with a link to join a Zoom or Google Meet call if selected.

The event details will also include a Fillout link to **Cancel or reschedule** the meeting. To `Reschedule`, click that same link.
