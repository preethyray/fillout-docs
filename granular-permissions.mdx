## Manage team members with granular permissions

You can limit the access given to any user in your Fillout organization. [Invite](/invite-collaborators) them to have `Limited Access`.

<Frame>

</Frame>

`+ Add workspace` along with their respective access level:

- **Full access** - allows a user to view and edit forms and responses
- **Read-only** - lets users view forms and submissions, but not edit the forms

<Note>
  **Note:** Granular permissions are available on the **Enterprise** plan. [Learn more here](https://www.fillout.com/enterprise).
</Note>

## View existing permissions

Click your **account name** in the bottom right corner followed by `Settings & Members`.

<Frame>
  ![View existing permissions](/images/account/image-12.png)
</Frame>

## Admin vs non-admins

**Admins** can access all workspaces, integrations, and organization settings. **Non-admins** have limited access based on their assigned workspaces and can't change organization settings. The **account owner** is the first user created on the account and has admin privileges by default.

## Limit access to integrations (connected accounts)

To limit which team members can access which integrations, log in as an admin and head to `Integrations`.

<Frame>
  ![Limit access to integrations (connected accounts)](/images/account/image-13.png)
</Frame>

By default, [integrations](/integrations) are accessible to all workspaces. To limit access to a connected account, hover over an integration and click `All`.

<Frame>
  ![Limit access to integrations (connected accounts)](/images/account/image-14.png)
</Frame>

Next, select `Limited workspaces` and choose the workspaces that you would like to share the integration connection with.

<Frame>
  ![Limit access to integrations (connected accounts)](/images/account/image-15.png)
</Frame>

Users who are part of of the allowed workspaces will be able to create new forms and edit existing ones that use that integration. Users who do not have access will not be able to use the integration.

## Limitations

**Only applies if using Zapier/Make**

Zapier and Make integrations currently don't support granular permissions. Therefore, **only an admin can connect Zapier or Make** to Fillout (Fillout doesn’t allow non-admins to connect to Zapier or Make). Once connected by an admin, ensure that Fillout integration access is granted exclusively to users who should have permission to add webhooks to **all forms across all workspaces**.

If you need granular permissions for Zapier/Make, we instead recommend using the per-form [webhook integration](/webhook) to trigger external automations.
