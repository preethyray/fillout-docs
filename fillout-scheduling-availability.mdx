## How to set up

In the `Scheduling` dashboard, go to `Availability` to edit your default **Working hours**.

Edit each day’s availability individually, or click the `+` button beside a day to split your availability and leave a buffer for a lunch break, for example. You can also change your preferred **Timezone** here.

<Note>
  **Note:** Fillout Scheduling shares availability across all your forms. Any changes made to your available hours will update all forms.
</Note>

You can also tweak all these while building a new scheduling form. Go to **Availability** in the left-hand panel to `Edit` your available hours.

You can't set availability for a specific date. To adjust for a special schedule, block the day in Google Calendar or temporarily edit Fillout’s weekly availability, then revert it next week.

## Add multiple availabilities

You can add more availabilities to organize your time better. Go to `Availability` in the left-hand panel to add `+ New availability`, enter a name, and set your preferred hours.

## Add buffer times

You can toggle the `Buffer Time` switch to add break times before and/or after an event. This gives you time to prepare for the next event or wrap up the previous one.
